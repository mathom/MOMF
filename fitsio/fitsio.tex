\chapter{Introduction }
\pagenumbering{arabic}

FITSIO is a machine-independent library of Fortran-77 subroutines for
reading and writing data files in the FITS (Flexible Image Transport
System) data format. This library was written to provide a powerful yet
simple interface for accessing FITS files which will run on most
commonly used computers and workstations. This version of FITSIO
supports all the features described in the official NOST definition of
the FITS format and can read and write all the currently defined types
of extensions, including ASCII tables (TABLE), Binary tables (BINTABLE)
and IMAGE extensions. The FITSIO subroutines insulate the programmer
from having to deal with the complicated formatting details in the FITS
file, however, it is assumed that users have a general knowledge about
the structure and usage of FITS files.

The FITSIO package was developed for use by the HEASARC (High Energy
Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center) at the NASA Goddard Space
Flight Center to convert various existing and newly acquired
astronomical data sets into FITS format and to further analyze data
already in FITS format. The latest version of the FITSIO source code,
documentation, and example programs are all available on the World-Wide
Web at the following URL:

\begin{verbatim}
       http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio
\end{verbatim}
FITSIO also can be obtained from the HEASARC via anonymous ftp from
{\bf legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov} in the {\bf software/fitsio/fortran}
subdirectory.

Any questions, bug reports, or suggested enhancements related to the FITSIO
package should be sent to the author:

\chapter{ Creating the FITSIO Library }


\section{Machine Specific Versions}

The FITSIO package consists of about 30000 lines of Fortran source code
contained in about 350 subroutines.  The large majority of subroutines
are written in strict Fortran-77 (except for the occasional use of
INTEGER*2 variables) and are contained in the file named fitsio.f.
These subroutines can be compiled and run on any machine that has a
Fortran-77 compiler.  A second file, called fitsfort.f, contains
additional general subroutines that are used in all cases except for
the IRAF/SPP version (which does not use Fortran read and write
statements).

To complete the FITSIO library, an additional set of machine-specific
subroutines must be added.  These subroutines allow for
compiler-specific differences in the file OPEN statement, the
subroutine to determine the current date, and a few other non-portable
aspects of Fortran-77.

Recently fitsio has been ported to be compilant with Fortran-90
compilers.  The fitsf90.f source file is intended to be used with any
Fortran-90 compiler, but it has only been tested on few F90
compilers.

The build scripts included in the FITSIO release will automatically
include the correct machine-specific Fortran-77 source file, but for
reference, the following table shows which file should be used on
various machines:


\begin{verbatim}
         PLATFORM                                    SOURCE FILE
         --------                                    -----------
    All Fortran-90 compilers                         fitsf90.f
    SUN, HP, IBM AIX workstations                    fitssun.f
    DEC Ultrix, DEC Alphas OSF/1, SGI, NeXT(Oasys)   fitsdec.f
    NeXT (with Absoft Fortran)                       fitsnxab.f
    Linux UNIX operating system on IBM PCs           fitslinx.f
    VAX/VMS (also need vmsieeed.mar)                 fitsvax.f
    DEC Alpha with OpenVMS                           fitsalphavms.f
    Cray supercomputers                              fitscray.f
    Macintosh PCs + Absoft Fortran                   fitsmac.f
    Macintosh PCs + Language Systems Fortran         fitsmacls.f
\end{verbatim}

Note that IBM mainframe computers and some older compilers for IBM PC
clones are no longer supported by this version of FITSIO.  The
previous 4.14 version of FITSIO may still be used on these platforms.
The fitsf90.f file should work with most newer Fortran-90
compilers on IBM PCs.

A version of FITSIO is also available which runs in the IRAF
environment and provides a set of SPP callable interface routines. See
the later section of this guide for more information on this IRAF
version.


\section{Building the Fortran Library}

A set of Make files and command files are provided with FITSIO to
automate the process of building the FITSIO library on most machines.
The following sections describe the build procedure for each type of machine.


\subsection{Unix Platforms}

The FITSIO library is built on most Unix systems by typing:

\begin{verbatim}
   > configure
   > make
\end{verbatim}
at the operating system prompt.  The `configure' command customizes the
Makefile for the particular system, then the `make' command builds the
library.  The build process splits each routine in the source files
into a separate disk file in a scratch subdirectory and may take some
time to finish, depending on the speed of the processor.

On HP-UX systems using an older Fortran-77 compiler, programs that call
FITSIO should be compiled and linked with the +U77 switch (to bring in
the idate library function) and the +E5 switch (to enable the same FITS
file to be attached to multiple Fortran unit numbers).  The idate
subroutine is only needed when writing the DATE FITS keyword with the
FTPDAT subroutine.  For example, to compile the testprog.f program
type:

\begin{verbatim}
    fort77 +U77 -o testprog testprog.f -L. -lfitsio
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{VMS Platforms}

The makevms.com and command file may be used to build the FITSIO
library on DEC Alpha/OSF and VAX/VMS machines (e.g., type `@makevmv' on
the command line).  Note that the vmsieeed.mar macro routine is used on
VAX/VMS systems to perform the translations between Vax floating point
formats and IEEE floating point formats.

FITSIO supports both the G\_float (default) and D\_float compiler options
on Alpha VMS systems.  The vmsieee.c routines perform the the IEEE
translations on Alpha VMS machines when the /float=D\_float compiler
option is invoked.  Th makevmsd.com file can be used to build FITSIO
with this option.


\subsection{IBM Compatible PCs running DOS or Windows}

This version of FITSIO currently requires a Fortran-90 compiler to
build on an IBM PC running DOS or Windows.  The previous 4.14 version
of FITSIO may still be used with the older Fortran-77 compilers.  In
fact it is probably not difficult to port this new version FITSIO to
run with most older compilers;  anyone wishing to do so should contact
the author for assistance.

To build the FITSIO library with a Fortran-90 compiler, one needs to
compile all the subroutines in fitsio.f, fitsfort.f, and fitsf90.f.
It usually results in smaller and more efficient code if each
subroutine in these source files is split into a separate file before
compiling, rather than compiling the entire large source file at once.
A program called split.f is included with the fitsio distribution which
will split the fitsio.f and fitsfort.f subroutines into separate
files.

The exact commands to compile and build the library depend on the
compiler, but the following example for the Microsoft PowerStation
Fortran compiler illustrates the sequence of steps that are required:

\begin{verbatim}
        #  compile and link the split program:
        FL32 SPLIT.F

        #  run split to break the large sources files into
        #  many smaller files:
        SPLIT

        #  compile all the small files; write output to a log file:
        FL32 /C FT*.F, FITSF90.F >COMPILE.LOG

        # create the fitsio object library; write output to a log file
        LINK32 -LIB /OUT:FITSIO.LIB FT*.OBJ, FITSF90.OBJ >LINKER.LOG
\end{verbatim}

The object module library, FITSIO.LIB, may then be used when linking
any program that calls the FITSIO subroutines.


\subsection{Using Macintosh PCs}

There are currently 2 versions of FITSIO for use with different Fortran
compilers on Macintosh PCs.  The fitsmac.f file is for the Absoft
compiler, and the fitsmacls.f file should be used with the Language
Systems Fortran (V3.3) compiler.  The MacMakefiles.sit.hqx file
contains libfitsio.make which will build libfitsio.f.o.  Use Stuffit
Expander (freeware, see any good archive site) to unbinhex and unstuff
these files.  You can change FMakeOptions and FLinkOptions if you
want.  For instance, set

\begin{verbatim}
FMakeOptions = ... -sym
FLinkOptions = ... -sym ON
\end{verbatim}
to use SADE. FITSIO has not been extensively tested on Mac systems, so
please report any problems or additional suggestions for successfully
building FITSIO on Macs to the author.


\subsection{Using the f2c Compiler}

The widely available f2c program may be used to convert the fortran
FITSIO source files into C code, which then may be processed by a C
compiler.  This avoids the need to have a Fortran compiler to build the
FITSIO library.  The fitsio.f file should process through f2c without
any problems, but the machine-dependent version of FITSIO may have a
few non-standard fortran statements which f2c will not understand.  One
such case is the use of the IDATE subroutine, or equivalent, to get the
system date which is used in the ftgsdt subroutine.  The easiest
workaround to this problem is to simply comment out this call and then
avoid calling the ftpdat subroutine, which is the only FITSIO
subroutine to use this function.


\subsection{The IRAF SPP Compatible Version of FITSIO}

An IRAF compatible version of FITSIO was developed in collaboration
with Doug Tody at NOAO.  This version of FITSIO uses the IRAF VOS
(Virtual Operating System) file I/O calls to access the FITS files
rather than using Fortran I/O,

The following source files are needed to build the IRAF compatible version
of FITSIO:

\begin{verbatim}
fitsio.f     - The Fortran source code for the main body of FITSIO subroutines
fitsio.h     - The SPP include file, used by fitspp.x and fitssppb.x
fitsspp.com  - The SPP common block used by fitsspp.x
fitsspp.x    - The low-level FITSIO subroutines, written in SPP
fitssppvms.x - Version of fitsspp.x for use on VAX and Alpha VMS machines
fitssppb.x   - The top-level SPP interface to FITSIO
mkpkg        - a sample make file which builds the FITSIO library
\end{verbatim}
The SPP version of FITSIO consists of 3 layers of code.  At the bottom
there is the fitsspp.x SPP source code which contains the IRAF-specific
subroutines to read and write data to the FITS file.  The middle layer
of subroutines are contained in the fitsio.f file which is the same
file used in every version of FITSIO.  This layer is completely portable and
contains no machine or environment dependencies.  Finally, a thin interface
layer of SPP subroutines are provided in the fitssppb.x file.  This top layer
of routines is provided for the convenience of SPP programmers and simply
performs the conversion between SPP character variables and Fortran character
strings.

A sample mkpkg file is provided which will build the FITSIO library in IRAF.
There are 2 versions of the fitsspp.x file; the fitssppvms.x file is used
on VAX and Alpha VMS machines, while the fitsspp.x file is used on
all other platforms.  Note that the `fitsio.f' file must be renamed
to `fitsio.for' for the mkpkg to function properly.

Once the FITSIO library has been built, IRAF programmers may then call
either the SPP or the Fortran subroutine interface to FITSIO; both
interfaces end up calling the same low-level SPP VOS interface routines
to actually read or write the FITS files.   IRAF programs written in
Fortran (using either the IRAF IMFORT or the STScI F77 interface to
access the IRAF VOS) can simply call the Fortran subroutine interface
to FITSIO as specified in later sections of this document.

Programs written in SPP, on the other hand, may call the SPP specific
layer of FITSIO subroutines.  These routines are identical to the
Fortran subroutines except that the SPP subroutines have names
beginning with 'fs' rather than 'ft' (e.g., 'call fsopen' rather than
'call ftopen').  The main purpose of this thin layer of SPP routines is
to convert any SPP character variables into Fortran character strings
before calling the corresponding FITSIO Fortran subroutine.  Similarly,
any  character strings that are returned by the Fortran FITSIO
subroutine are converted into SPP CHAR variables before being passed
back to the calling SPP routine.

SPP programmers, therefore, should follow the definition of all the
FITSIO interface subroutines given in this document, except that the
SPP routines have names beginning with 'fs' rather than 'ft', and SPP
CHAR variables should be substituted for any Fortran character string
variables in the subroutine calling arguments. SPP programmers also
need to be aware of the character string length definitions that are
used throughout the SPP FITSIO interface as defined in the fitsio.h
include file. The SPP version of FITSIO behaves identically to the
Fortran version and has exactly the same calling sequences, except for
the following special exceptions:


\begin{description}
\item[* ] FSPKNx:  This family of subroutines only supports a single comment string,
   not an array of comment strings as in the Fortran routines.
\end{description}


\begin{description}
\item[* ] FSPCLS, FSGCVS, and FSGCFS:  These 3 routines all have an additional
    argument not present in the corresponding Fortran routines.
    This integer argument, DIM1, follows the character array
    argument and specifies the size of the 1st dimension of
   the 2-dimensional CHAR array, e.g.,
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
    call fspcls(ounit, frow, felem, nelem, nulval, array, DIM1, anynul, status)
\end{verbatim}


\section{Testing the FITSIO Library}

The FITSIO library should be tested by building and running
the testprog.f program that is included with the release.
On Unix systems type:

\begin{verbatim}
    % f77 -o testprog testprog.f -L. -lfitsio
    % testprog > testprog.lis
    % cmp -l testprog.fft testprog.std
    % diff testprog.lis testprog.out
\end{verbatim}
 On VMS systems type:

\begin{verbatim}
    $ for testprog.f
    $ link testprog, fitsio/lib
    $ run testprog
\end{verbatim}
The testprog program should produce a long set of diagnostic output
messages ending with an 'OK' status, identical to those contained in
the testprog.out file.  The output FITS file, called testprog.fft,
should be identical to the testprog.std FITS file included in this
release.  The 'cmp' command shown above should not report any
differences between these 2 files except that on a few systems (e.g.,
HP-UX and LINUX) a few bytes may differ where a floating point number
is formated with a leading blank instead of a leading zero in front of
the decimal place (e.g. ' .000000' instead of '0.000000').


\section{Getting Started with FITSIO}

In order to effectively use the FITSIO library as quickly as possible,
it is recommended that new users follow these steps:

1.  Read the following `FITS Primer' chapter for a brief
overview of the structure of FITS files.  This is especially important
for users who have not previously dealt with the FITS table and image
extensions.

2.  Write a simple program to read or write a FITS file using the Basic
Interface routines described in Chapter 6.

3.  Refer to the cookbook.f program that is included with this release
for examples of routines that perform various common FITS file
operations.

4. Read Chapters 4 and 5 to become familiar with the conventions and
advanced features of the FITSIO interface.

5.  Scan through the more extensive set of routines that are provided
in the `Advanced Interface', as described in Chapter 7.  These routines
perform more specialized functions than are provided by the Basic
Interface routines.


\section{Example Program}

The following listing shows an example of how to use the FITSIO
routines in a Fortran program.  Refer to the cookbook.f program that
is included with the FITSIO distribution for examples of other
FITS programs.

\begin{verbatim}
      program writeimage

C     Create a FITS primary array containing a 2-D image

      integer status,unit,blocksize,bitpix,naxis,naxes(2)
      integer i,j,group,fpixel,nelements,array(300,200)
      character filename*80
      logical simple,extend

      status=0
C     Name of the FITS file to be created:
      filename='ATESTFILE.FITS'

C     Get an unused Logical Unit Number to use to create the FITS file
      call ftgiou(unit,status)

C     create the new empty FITS file
      blocksize=1
      call ftinit(unit,filename,blocksize,status)

C     initialize parameters about the FITS image (300 x 200 16-bit integers)
      simple=.true.
      bitpix=16
      naxis=2
      naxes(1)=300
      naxes(2)=200
      extend=.true.

C     write the required header keywords
      call ftphpr(unit,simple,bitpix,naxis,naxes,0,1,extend,status)

C     initialize the values in the image with a linear ramp function
      do j=1,naxes(2)
          do i=1,naxes(1)
              array(i,j)=i+j
          end do
      end do

C     write the array to the FITS file
      group=1
      fpixel=1
      nelements=naxes(1)*naxes(2)
      call ftpprj(unit,group,fpixel,nelements,array,status)

C     write another optional keyword to the header
      call ftpkyj(unit,'EXPOSURE',1500,'Total Exposure Time',status)

C     close the file and free the unit number
      call ftclos(unit, status)
      call ftfiou(unit, status)
      end
\end{verbatim}

\section{Calling FITSIO from C programs  (Obsolete Section)}

[Note added March 1996:  This section is now obsolete.  C programmers
should use the CFITSIO library, written entirely in ANSI-C
rather than the CFORTRAN macros described below.]

C programmers may call the Fortran FITSIO subroutines by using a set of
macro definitions included in the cfitsio.h header file that is
distributed as part of the FITSIO package. This header file defines a C
macro corresponding to every Fortran subroutine in the FITSIO user
interface. These macros provide a machine-independent interface between
C and Fortran by using the CFORTRAN package (actually a C header file)
developed by Burkhard Burow (burow@vxdesy.cern.ch, U. of Toronto).

The CFITSIO macros have the same calling sequence as the FITSIO Fortran
subroutines defined in this FITSIO User's Guide.  The only difference
is that the macro routines all have uppercase names and they begin with
the letters 'FC' rather then 'ft' as in all the fortran subroutine
names.   As an example, one would call ftclos(unit, status) in fortran
but would call FCCLOS(unit,\&status) when calling the CFITSIO macros in
a C program.  Programmers should refer to the wsimple.c and rsimple.c
sample programs that are distributed with FITSIO for examples of how to
call the FITSIO routines.

To use CFITSIO, one  must include the cfitsio.h header file at the
beginning of the C program.  Note that cfitsio.h requires 2 other C
header files, cfortran.h and pctype.h, (which are also distributed with
FITSIO) but these do not need to be explicitly included in the C
application program.

C programmers should be aware that there are subtle differences between
C and Fortran in the use of character strings and especially vectors of
character strings.  Please read the comments at the beginning of the
cfitsio.h file for a summary of the restrictions when calling the
FITSIO routines that have character string arguments.

C programs that call CFITSIO must be linked to include the Fortran
language libraries that are needed by FITSIO (since it is written in
Fortran). The exact link procedure is necessarily machine dependent,
and unfortunately is not always obvious because of various pecularities
in either the C or Fortran compilers.  The following guidelines may be
helpful in sorting out the correct link procedure on Unix platforms.

There are basically 2 options for linking a C program that calls
Fortran routines.  The first and simplest option, when it works, is to
use the `f77' command to link the C program;  this will automatically
link in the required Fortran language libraries without having to
specify their names or directory path.  For example, if one has a C
program called foo.c which calls cfitsio, it may be compiled and linked
with the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
% cc -c foo.c
% f77 -o foo foo.o -L$FITSDIR -lfitsio
\end{verbatim}
where \$FITSDIR is an environment variable which points to the
directory where the fitsio library has been installed (use `-L.' if the
fitsio library is located in the current work directory).
Unfortunately, using f77 to perform the linking does not always work,
especially if the C and Fortran compilers are supplied by different
vendors (e.g., when combining gcc with a commercial Fortran compiler).
The error message that is reported in this case usually says something
about an undefined or unresolved symbol `main'.

If this error occurs, then a more orthodox linking procedure must be
used which requires that the names and path to the Fortran language
libraries be explicitly specified.  The compile and link commands,
(using `gcc' instead of `cc' in this example) would look something
like:

\begin{verbatim}
% gcc -c foo.c
% gcc -o foo foo.o -L$FITSDIR -lfitsio $F77LFLAGS
\end{verbatim}
where \$F77LFLAGS is a platform-specific environment variable which
specifies the Fortran 77 libraries that need to be linked with the program.
It may require some detective work to determine where the Fortran
libraries are located on any given machine.  One method for finding
them is to compile any simple Fortran program (such as the standard
`Hello, world!' program) using the -v option, as in

\begin{verbatim}
% f77 -v -o test test.f
\end{verbatim}
This will produce a verbose compile and link listing, with a line
that looks something like:

\begin{verbatim}
/bin/ld -dc -dp -e start -u _MAIN_ -X -o test /usr/lang/SC1.0/crt0.o
 /usr/lang/SC1.0/cg87/_crt1.o -L/usr/lang/SC1.0/cg87 -L/usr/lang/SC1.0
 test.o -lF77 -lm -lc
\end{verbatim}
From this listing it should be possible to decipher the names of the
Fortran libraries and their location.  In this case the libraries are
located in /usr/lang/SC1.0 and they are called libF77.a and libm.a.
Thus to link the example cfitsio program on this machine, one would
specify:

\begin{verbatim}
% gcc -c foo.c
% gcc -o foo foo.o -L$FITSDIR -lfitsio -L/usr/lang/SC1.0 -lF77 -lm
\end{verbatim}
Another method of locating the Fortran libraries is to execute `which f77'
then search that directory, and any subdirectories, for the libraries.

For reference, here is the value for F77LFLAGS what was found to work
on various platforms:

\begin{verbatim}

\chapter{  A FITS Primer }

This section gives a brief overview of the structure of FITS files.
Users should refer to the documentation available from the NOST, as
described in the introduction, for more detailed information on FITS
formats.

FITS was first developed in the late 1970's as a standard data
interchange format between various astronomical observatories.  Since
then FITS has become the defacto standard data format supported by most
astronomical data analysis software packages.

A FITS file consists of one or more Header + Data Units (HDUs), where
the first HDU is called the `Primary HDU', or `Primary Array'.  The
primary array contains an N-dimensional array of pixels, such as a 1-D
spectrum, a 2-D image, or a 3-D data cube.  The primary HDU can also
consist of only a header with a null array containing no pixels.

Any number of additional HDUs may follow the primary array; these
additional HDUs are called FITS `extensions'.  There are currently 3
types of extensions defined by the FITS standard:

\begin{verbatim}
  Image Extension - a N-dimensional array of pixels, like in a primary array

  ASCII Table Extension - rows and columns of data in ASCII character format

  Binary Table Extension - rows and columns of data in binary representation
\end{verbatim}
In each case the HDU consists of an ASCII Header Unit followed by an optional
Data Unit.  For historical reasons, each Header or Data unit must be an
exact multiple of 2880 8-bit bytes long.  Any unused space is padded
with fill characters (ASCII blanks or NULs depending on the type of unit).

Each Header Unit consists of any number of 80-character keyword records
or `card images' (reminiscent of the 80-column punched cards which
were prevalent when the FITS standard was developed) which have the
general form:

\begin{verbatim}
  KEYNAME = value / comment string
\end{verbatim}
The keyword names may be up to 8 characters long and can only contain
uppercase letters, the digits 0-9, the hyphen, and the underscore
character. The keyword name is (usually) followed by an equals sign and
a space character (= ) in columns 9 - 10 of the record, followed by the
value of the keyword which may be either an integer, a floating point
number, a character string (enclosed in single quotes), or a boolian
value (the letter T or F).   A keyword may also have a null or undefined
value if there is no specified value string, as in the following example:

\begin{verbatim}
  KEYNAME =         / comment: keyword has no value
\end{verbatim}
The last keyword in the header is always the `END' keyword which has no
value or comment fields. There are many rules governing the exact
format of a keyword record (see the NOST FITS Standard) so it is better
to rely on standard interface software like FITSIO to correctly
construct or to parse the keyword records rather than try to deal
directly with the raw FITS formats.

Each Header Unit begins with a series of required keywords which depend
on the type of HDU.  These required keywords specify the size and
format of the following Data Unit.  The header many contain other
optional keywords to describe other aspects of the data, such as the
units or scaling values.  Other COMMENT or HISTORY keywords are also
frequently added to further document the data file.

The optional Data Unit immediately follows the last 2880-byte block in
the Header Unit.  Some HDUs do not have a Data Unit and only consist of
the Header Unit.

If there is more than one HDU in the FITS file, then the Header Unit of
the next HDU immediately follows the last 2880-byte block of the
previous Data Unit (or Header Unit if there is no Data Unit).


\chapter{ Basic FITSIO Conventions }


\section{Current Header Data Unit (CHDU)}

A basic concept used throughout FITSIO is that of the current Header
Data Unit (CHDU) within the FITS file. The FITSIO subroutines which read
or write information only operate on the CHDU.  When a FITS file is first
created or opened the CHDU is automatically defined to be the first HDU
(i.e., the primary array).  FITSIO subroutines are provided to move
to and open any other existing HDU within the FITS file or to append or
insert a new HDU in the FITS file which then becomes the CHDU.


\section{Subroutine Names}

All FITSIO subroutine names begin with the letters 'ft' to distinguish
them from other subroutines and are 5 or 6 characters long. Users should
not name their own subroutines beginning with 'ft' to avoid conflicts.
(The SPP interface routines all begin with 'fs'). Subroutines which read
or get information from the FITS file have names beginning with
'ftg...'. Subroutines which write or put information into the FITS file
have names beginning with 'ftp...'.


\section{Subroutine Families and Datatypes}

Many of the subroutines come in families which differ only in the
datatype of the associated parameter(s) .  The datatype of these
subroutines is indicated by the last letter of the subroutine name
(e.g., 'j' in 'ftpkyj') as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
        x - bit
        b - character*1 (unsigned byte)
        i - short integer (I*2)
        j - integer (I*4)
        e - real exponential floating point (R*4)
        f - real fixed-format floating point (R*4)
        d - double precision real floating-point (R*8)
        g - double precision fixed-format floating point (R*8)
        c - complex reals (pairs of R*4 values)
        m - double precision complex (pairs of R*8 values)
        l - logical (L*4)
        s - character string
\end{verbatim}

When dealing with the FITS byte datatype, it is important to remember
that the raw values (before any scaling by the BSCALE and BZERO, or
TSCALn and TZEROn keyword values) in byte arrays (BITPIX = 8) or byte
columns (TFORMn = 'B') are interpreted as unsigned bytes with values
ranging from 0 to 255. Some Fortran compilers support a non-standard
byte datatype such as INTEGER*1, LOGICAL*1, or BYTE, which can sometimes
be used instead of CHARACTER*1 variables. Many machines permit passing a
numeric datatype (such as INTEGER*1) to the FITSIO subroutines which are
expecting a CHARACTER*1 datatype, but this technically violates the
Fortran-77 standard and is not supported on all machines (e.g., on a VAX/VMS
machine one must use the VAX-specific \%DESCR function).

The double precision complex datatype is not a standard Fortran-77
datatype.  If a particular Fortran compiler does not directly support
this datatype,  then one may instead pass an array of pairs of double
precision values to these subroutines.  The first  value in each pair
is the real part, and the second is the imaginary part.


\section{Implicit Data Type Conversion}

Many of the data I/O subroutines have the ability to perform implicit
data type conversion. This means that the data type of the subroutine
parameter does not need to be the same as the data type of the value in
the FITS file. More specifically, the implicit data type conversion will
be performed for numerical data types when reading a FITS header keyword
value and when reading or writing values to or from the primary array or
a table column. FITSIO returns status = 412 if the converted data value
exceeds the range of the output data type. Data type conversion is not
allowed when reading or writing string (s), logical (l), complex (c), or
double complex (m) data types.

One feature of the FITSIO routines is that they can operate on a `X'
(bit) column in a binary table as though it were a `B' (byte) column.
For example a `11X' datatype column can be interpreted the same as a
`2B' column (i.e., 2 unsigned 8-bit bytes). In some instances, it can be
more efficient to read and write whole bytes at a time, rather than
reading or writing each individual bit (with the ftgcx and ftpclx
routines).


\section{Data Scaling}

When reading numerical data values in the primary array or a
table column, the values will be scaled automatically by the BSCALE and
BZERO (or TSCALn and TZEROn) header keyword values if they are
present in the header.  The scaled data that is returned to the reading
program will have

\begin{verbatim}
        output value = (FITS value) * BSCALE + BZERO
\end{verbatim}
(a corresponding formula using TSCALn and TZEROn is used when reading
from table columns).  In the case of integer output values the floating
point scaled value is truncated to an integer (not rounded to the
nearest integer).  The ftpscl and fttscl subroutines may be used to
override the scaling parameters defined in the header (e.g., to turn
off the scaling so that the program can read the raw unscaled values
from the FITS file).

When writing numerical data to the primary array or to a table
column the data values will generally be automatically inversely scaled
by the value of the BSCALE and BZERO (or TSCALn and TZEROn) header
keyword values if they they exist in the header.  These keywords must
have been written to the header before any data is written for them to
have any effect.  Otherwise, one may use the ftpscl and fttscl
subroutines to define or override the scaling keywords in the header
(e.g., to turn off the scaling so that the program can write the raw
unscaled values into the FITS file). If scaling is performed, the
inverse scaled output value that is written into the FITS file will
have

\begin{verbatim}
         FITS value = ((input value) - BZERO) / BSCALE
\end{verbatim}
(a corresponding formula using TSCALn and TZEROn is used when
writing to table columns).  Rounding to the nearest integer, rather
than truncation, is performed when writing integer datatypes to the
FITS file.


\section{Error Status Values and the Error Message Stack}

The last parameter in nearly every FITSIO subroutine is the error
status value which is both an input and an output parameter.  A
returned positive value for this parameter indicates an error was
detected.  A listing of all the FITSIO status code values is given at
the end of this document.

The FITSIO library uses an `inherited status' convention for the status
parameter which means that if a subroutine is called with a positive
input value of the status parameter, then the subroutine will exit
immediately without changing the value of the status parameter.  Thus,
if one passes the status value returned from each FITSIO routine as
input to the next FITSIO subroutine, then whenever an error is detected
all further FITSIO processing will cease.  This convention can simplify
the error checking in application programs because it is not necessary
to check the value of the status parameter after every single FITSIO
subroutine call.  If a program contains a sequence of several FITSIO
calls, one can just check the status value after the last call.  Since
the returned status values are generally distinctive, it should be
possible to determine which subroutine originally returned the error
status.

FITSIO also maintains an internal stack of error messages (80-character
maximum length) which in many cases provide a more detailed explanation
of the cause of the error than is provided by the error status number
alone. It it recommended that the error message stack be printed out
whenever a program detects a FITSIO error. To do this, call the FTGMSG
routine repeatedly to get the successive messages on the stack. When the
stack is empty FTGMSG will return a blank string. Note that this is a
`First In -- First Out' stack, so the oldest error message is returned
first by ftgmsg.

In some situations programs may encounter a non-fatal FITSIO error and
will want to continue processing.  An example is when a program fails
to find an optional keyword in the header and FITSIO returns status =
202.  The program may ignore this error and reset status=0, however
this may still leave error messages on the stack.  To clear the entire
message stack in this situation, call the FTCMSG subroutine.


\section{Variable-Length Array Facility in Binary Tables}

FITSIO provides easy-to-use support for reading and writing data in
variable length fields of a binary table. The variable length columns
have TFORMn keyword values of the form `1Pt(len)' where `t' is the
datatype code (e.g., I, J, E, D, etc.) and `len' is an integer
specifying the maximum length of the vector in the table.  If the value
of `len' is not specified when the table is created (e.g., if the TFORM
keyword value is simply specified as '1PE' instead of '1PE(400) ), then
CFITSIO will automatically scan the table when it is closed to
determine the maximum length of the vector and will append this value
to the TFORMn value.

The same routines which read and write data in an ordinary fixed length
binary table extension are also used for variable length fields,
however, the subroutine parameters take on a slightly different
interpretation as described below.

All the data in a variable length field is written into an area called
the `heap' which follows the main fixed-length FITS binary table.  The
size of the heap, in bytes, is specified with the PCOUNT keyword
in the FITS header.  When creating a new binary table, the initial value of
PCOUNT should usually be set to zero. FITSIO will recompute the size of
the heap as the data is written and will automatically update the PCOUNT
keyword value when the table is closed. Thus, application programs
usually do not need to worry about the heap size except when inserting
a new binary table HDU in front of other existing HDUs in the FITS file
(with ftibin). In this specific case the correct final value of PCOUNT
(or a larger value) must be specified when the HDU is initially created
so that the correct amount of space will be inserted into the FITS file.

By default the heap data area starts immediately after the last row of
the fixed-length table.  (This default starting location may be
overridden by the THEAP keyword, but this is not recommended).  Thus
when writing variable length arrays the number of rows in the table
should be correctly specified (with the NAXIS2 keyword) at the time the
table is first created.  This differs from the simpler case of tables
that only contain fixed-length columns where the number of rows in the
table does not have to be explicitly defined until just before the
table is closed.  It is still possible to insert additional rows into a
binary table containing variable-length columns (with the FTIROW
routine), however, the performance may be rather slow due to all the
internal shuffling of the data that must be performed.

When writing to a variable length field, the entire array of values for
a given row of the table must be written with a single call to FTPCLx.
The total length of the array is calculated from (NELEM+FELEM-1). One
cannot append more elements to an existing field at a later time; any
attempt to do so will simply overwrite all the data which was previously
written. Note also that the new data will be written to a new area of
the heap and the heap space used by the previous write cannot be
reclaimed. For this reason it is advised that each row of a variable
length field only be written once. An exception to this general rule
occurs when setting elements of an array as undefined. One must first
write a dummy value into the array with FTPCLx, and then call FTPCLU to
flag the desired elements as undefined. (Do not used the FTPCNx family
of routines with variable length fields). Note that the rows of a table
may be written in any order.

When reading or writing to a variable length ASCII character field
(e.g., TFORM = '1PA') only a single character string is read or
written.  The number of characters in the string is specified with the
NELEM parameter (the FELEM parameter is ignored).

The FTPDES subroutine is useful in situations where multiple rows of a
variable length column have the identical array of values.  One can
simply write the array once for the first row, and then use FTPDES to
write the same descriptor values into the other rows (use the FTGDES
routine to read the first descriptor value);  all the rows will then
point to the same storage location thus saving disk space.

When reading from a variable length array field one can only read as many
elements as exist in that row of the table; reading does not automatically
continue with the next row of the table as occurs when reading an ordinary
fixed length table field.  Attempts to read more than this will return an
error.  One can determine the length of each row of the field with the
FTGDES subroutine.


\section{Support for IEEE Special Values}

The ANSI/IEEE-754 floating-point number standard defines certain
special values that are used to represent such quantities as
Not-a-Number (NaN), denormalized, underflow, overflow, and infinity.
(See the Appendix in the NOST FITS standard or the NOST FITS User's
Guide for a list of these values).  The FITSIO subroutines that read
floating point data in FITS files recognize these IEEE special values
and by default interpret the overflow and infinity values as being
equivalent to a NaN, and convert the underflow and denormalized values
into zeros.  In some cases programmers may want access to the raw IEEE
values, without any modification by FITSIO.  This can be done by
calling the FTGPVx or FTGCVx routines while specifying 0.0 as the value
of the NULLVAL parameter.  This will force FITSIO to simply pass the
IEEE values through to the application program, without any
modification.  This does not work for double precision values
on VAX/VMS machines, however,
where there is no easy way to bypass the default interpretation of the
IEEE special values.


\section{Local FITS Conventions supported by FITSIO}

In a couple cases FITSIO supports local FITS conventions which are not
defined in the official NOST FITS standard and which are not
necessarily recognized or supported by other FITS software packages.
Programmers should be cautious about using these features, especially
if the FITS files that are produced are expected to be processed by
other software systems which do not use the FITSIO interface.  These
local conventions should be considered as prototypes, and they may not
necessarily be supported in future versions of FITSIO, especially if an
alternative convention is officially adopted by the FITS community.


\subsection{Support for Long String Keyword Values.}

The length of a standard FITS string keyword is limited to 68
characters because it must fit entirely within a single FITS header
keyword record.  In some instances it is necessary to encode strings
longer than this limit, so FITSIO supports a local convention in which
the string value is continued over multiple keywords. This
continuation convention uses a ampersand character at the end of each
substring to indicate that it is continued on the next keyword, and the
continuation keywords all have the name CONTINUE without an equal sign
in column 9. The string value may be continued in this way over as many
additional CONTINUE keywords as is required.  The following lines
illustrate this continuation convention which is used in the value of
the STRKEY keyword:

\begin{verbatim}
LONGSTRN= 'OGIP 1.0'           / The OGIP Long String Convention may be used.
STRKEY  = 'This is a very long string keyword&'  / Optional Comment
CONTINUE  ' value that is continued over 3 keywords in the &  '
CONTINUE  'FITS header.' / This is another optional comment.
\end{verbatim}
It is recommended that the LONGSTRN keyword, as shown
here, always be included in any HDU that uses this longstring
convention.  A subroutine called FTPLSW
has been provided in FITSIO for this purpose.

This long string convention is supported by the following FITSIO
subroutines that deal with string-valued keywords:

\begin{verbatim}
      ftgkys - read a string keyword
      ftpkls - write (append) a string keyword
      ftikys - insert a string keyword
      ftmkys - modify the value of an existing string keyword
      ftukys - update an existing keyword, or write a new keyword
      ftdkey - delete a keyword
\end{verbatim}
These routines will transparently read, write, or delete a long string
value in the FITS file, so programmers in general to not have to be
concerned about the details of the convention that is used to encode
the long string in the FITS header.  When reading a long string, one
must ensure that the character string parameter used in these
subroutine calls has been declared long enough to hold the entire
string, otherwise the returned string value will be truncated.

Note that the more commonly used FITSIO subroutine to write string
valued keywords (FTPKYS) does NOT support this long string convention
and only supports strings up to 68 characters in length.  This has
been done deliberately
to prevent programs from inadvertently writing keywords using
this non-standard convention without the explicit intent of
the programmer or user.   The FTPKLS subroutine must be called
instead to write long strings.  This routine can also be used to write
ordinary string values less than 68 characters in length.


\subsection{Arrays of Strings in Binary Table Extensions}

The definition of the FITS binary table extension format does not
provide a simple way to specify that a character column contains an
array of fixed-length strings.  To support this feature, FITSIO uses a
local convention for the format of the TFORMn keyword value of the form
'rAw' where 'r' is an integer specifying the total width in characters
of the column, and 'w' is an integer specifying the (fixed) length of
an individual unit string within the vector.  For example, TFORM1 =
'120A10' would indicate that the binary table column is 120 characters
wide and consists of 12 10-character length strings.  This convention
is recognized by the FITSIO subroutines that read or write strings in
binary tables.   The Binary Table definition document specifies that
other optional characters may follow the datatype code in the TFORM
keyword, so this local convention is in compliance with the
FITS standard, although other FITS readers are not required to
recognize this convention.

The Binary Table definition document that was approved by the IAU in
1994 contains an appendix describing an alternate convention for
specifying arrays of fixed or variable length strings in a binary table
character column (with the form 'rA:SSTRw/nnn)'.  This appendix was not
officially voted on by the IAU and hence is still provisional.  FITSIO
does not currently support this proposal.


\subsection{Keyword Units Strings}

One deficiency of the current FITS Standard is that it does not define
a specific convention for recording the physical units of a keyword
value.  The TUNITn keyword can be used to specify the physical units of
the values in a table column, but there is no comparable convention for
keyword values.  The comment field of the keyword is often used for
this purpose, but the units are usually not specified in a well defined
format that FITS readers can easily recognize and extract.

To solve this deficiency, FITSIO uses a local convention in which the
keyword units are enclosed in square brackets as the first token in the
keyword comment field; more specifically, the opening square bracket
immediately follows the slash '/' comment field delimiter and a single
space character.  The following examples illustrate keywords that use
this convention:


\begin{verbatim}
EXPOSURE=               1800.0 / [s] elapsed exposure time
V_HELIO =                16.23 / [km s**(-1)] heliocentric velocity
LAMBDA  =                5400. / [angstrom] central wavelength
FLUX    = 4.9033487787637465E-30 / [J/cm**2/s] average flux
\end{verbatim}

In general, the units named in the IAU(1988) Style Guide are
recommended, with the main exception that the preferred unit for angle
is 'deg' for degrees.

The FTPUNT and FTGUNT subroutines in FITSIO write and read,
respectively, the keyword unit strings in an existing keyword.


\chapter{ Programming Guidelines }

The FITSIO Cookbook (available in the file cookbook.tex in the FITSIO
software distribution directory) contains annotated listings of various
programs that read and write FITSIO files.  New users of FITSIO should
study these example programs to help learn how to correctly use the
FITSIO library.   The following sections briefly summarize the
main steps in reading or writing a FITS file.


\section{Reading an existing FITS file}

The following sequence of subroutine calls illustrate a simple example
of reading an existing FITS file.  Refer to the FITSIO Cookbook
for more detailed examples of the correct FITSIO usage.

\begin{verbatim}
 1. Open the file with FTOPEN.
 2. Read any desired header keywords with FTGHPR or FTGKYx.
 3. Read the primary data, if any, with FTGPVx or FTGPFx.
 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all the desired information has been read.
 5. Move to another extension with FTMAHD or FTMRHD.
 6. Read any extension header keywords (e.g. with FTGHTB, FTGHBN or FTGKYx)
 7. Read any columns of data from the extension (e.g. with FTGCVx or FTGCFx)
 8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 until all the information has been read.
 9. Repeat steps 5 through 8 for any other extensions.
10. Close the file with FTCLOS.
\end{verbatim}


\section{Creating a new FITS file}

The following sequence of subroutine calls illustrate a simple example
of writing a new FITS file:

\begin{verbatim}
 1. Create the new file with FTINIT.
 2. Write the required primary array keywords with FTPHPR.
 3. Write any additional keywords with FTPKYx.
 4. Write the primary array data, if any, with FTPPRx.
 5. Create another extension, if desired, with FTCRHD.
 6. Write required header keywords for the extension with FTPHTB or FTPHBN.
 7. Write any additional keywords with FTPKYx
 8. Write data to the extension, one column at a time with FTPCLx
 9. Repeat steps 5 - 8 for any more extensions.
10. Close the FITS file with FTCLOS
\end{verbatim}
Note that the application program must not explicitly write the
required 'END' keyword at the end of each header;  the FITSIO interface
will automatically append the END record whenever the header is closed.
As a standard practice, users should always read back any FITS files
that they have created to ensure that the header values and data structure
are correct and self-consistent.


\section{When the Final Size of the FITS File is Unknown}

It is not required to know the total size of a FITS data array or table
before beginning to write the data to the FITS file.  In the case
of the primary array or an image extension, one should initially
create the array with the size of the highest dimension (largest
NAXISn keyword) set to a dummy value, such as 1.  Then after
all the data have been written and the true dimensions are known,
then the NAXISn value should be updated using the FTMKYJ subroutine
before moving to another extension or closing the FITS file.

A similar procedure may be used in the case of FITS tables, where
the number of rows in the table (the NAXIS2 value) may initially
be set to 1 and then updated with the correct value before
closing the table.  Alternatively, one may use the FTIROW routine
to insert additional rows into a table if the original value
turns out to be too small.  This latter method must be used if any
of the columns contain variable length arrays.


\section{Optimizing Code for Maximum Processing Speed}

Care must be taken when designing software to achieve the best possible
performance when processing the FITS data files. The following
paragraphs describe some strategies that may be used to improve the
processing speed of software that uses FITSIO.

1.  When dealing with a FITS primary array or IMAGE extension, it is
more efficient to read or write large chunks of the image at a time.
When reading or writing large chunks of contiguous data in the FITS
file (at least 3 FITS blocks = 8640 bytes) FITSIO bypasses the internal
buffers that it uses for small pieces of data (e.g., when reading FITS
keywords).   This is more efficient because the data are not copied to
the intermediate buffer.

2.  When dealing with FITS tables, the most important efficiency factor
in the software design is to read or write the data in the FITS file in
a single pass through the file.  An example of poor program design
would be to read a large, 3-column table by sequentially reading the
entire first column, then going back to read the 2nd column, and
finally the 3rd column; this obviously requires 3 passes through the
file which could triple the execution time of an I/O limited program.
For small tables this is not important, but when reading multi-megabyte
sized tables these inefficiencies can become significant.  The more
efficient procedure in this case is to read or write only as many rows
of the table as will fit into the available internal I/O buffers, then
access all the necessary columns of data within that range of rows.
Then after the program is completely finished with the data in those
rows it can move on to the next range of rows that will fit in the
buffers, continuing in this way until the entire file has been
processed.  By using this procedure of accessing all the columns of a
table in parallel rather than sequentially, each block of the FITS file
will only be read or written once.

The optimal number of rows to read or write at one time in a given
table depends on the width of the table row, on the number of I/O
buffers that have been allocated in FITSIO, and also on the number of
other FITS files that are open at the same time (since one I/O buffer
is always reserved for each open FITS file).  Fortunately, a FITSIO
routine is available that will return the optimal number of rows for a
given table:  call ftgrsz(unit, nrows, status).  It is not critical to
use exactly the value of nrows returned by this routine, as long as one
does not exceed it.  Using a very small value however can also lead to
poor preformance because of the overhead from the larger number of
subroutine calls.

The optimal number of rows returned by ftgrsz is valid only as long as
the application program is only reading or writing data in the
specified table.  Any other calls to access data in the table header or
in any other FITS file would  cause additional blocks of data to be
loaded into the I/O buffers displacing data from the original table,
and should be avoided during the critical period while the table is
being read or written.

Occasionally it is necessary to simultaneously access more than one
FITS table, for example when transfering values from an input table to
an output table.  In cases like this, one should call ftgrsz to get the
optimal number of rows for each table separately, than reduce the
number of rows proportionally.  For example, if the optimal number of
rows in the input table is 3600 and is 1400 in the output table, then
these values should be cut in half to 1800 and 700, respectively, if
both tables are going to be accessed at the same time.

3.  Alway use binary table extensions rather than ASCII table
extensions for better efficiency  when dealing with tabular data.  The
I/O to ASCII tables is slower because of the overhead in formatting or
parsing the ASCII data fields, and because ASCII tables are about twice
as large as binary tables with the same information content.

4. Design software so that it reads the FITS header keywords in the
same order in which they occur in the file.  When reading keywords,
FITSIO searches forward starting from the position of the last keyword
that was read.  If it reaches the end of the header without finding the
keyword, it then goes back to the start of the header and continues the
search down to the position where it started.  In practice, as long as
the entire FITS header can fit at one time in the available internal I/O
buffers, then the header keyword access will be very fast and it makes
little difference which order they are accessed.

5. Avoid the use of scaling (by using the BSCALE and BZERO or TSCAL and
TZERO keywords) in FITS files since the scaling operations add to the
processing time needed to read or write the data.  In some cases it may
be more efficient to temporarily turn off the scaling (using ftpscl or
fttscl) and then read or write the raw unscaled values in the FITS
file.

6. Avoid using the 'implicit datatype conversion' capability in
FITSIO.  For instance, when reading a FITS image with BITPIX = -32
(32-bit floating point pixels), read the data into a single precision
floating point data array in the program.  Forcing FITSIO to convert
the data to a different datatype can significantly slow the program.

7. Design FITS binary tables so that every column is aligned on a
computer word boundary and so that each row is a multiple number of
computer words in length.  Accessing non-aligned words can be slower on
some machines.  This is usually not a problem when using FITSIO to read
or write the FITS files, but other FITS readers and writers could be
affected.  In practice, this means that double precision columns should
start at a multiple of 8 bytes within the row, single precision
floating point columns and integer columns should start at a multiple
of 4 bytes, and short integer columns should start at a multiple of 2
bytes.  If necessary, the row length should be padded out by adding a
dummy column of the appropriate width or by adjusting the width of an
existing column so that the row length is also a multiple number of
words in length.  For example, if a binary table contains a '1B', a
'1E', and a '1D' column, then the optimum design would place the '1D'
column first in the table followed by the '1E' and then the '1B'
column.  Since the row length is then 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 bytes, one should
add another dummy column, with a 3A datatype to make the length a
multiple of the double precision word length.  Alternatively, one could
change the last column from '1B' to '4B'. This will insure that all the
data values are optimally aligned.

8. Where feasible, design FITS binary tables so that the columns of
data are written as a contiguous set of bytes, rather than as single
elements in multiple rows.  For example, it is much faster to access
the data in a table that contains a single row and 2 columns with TFORM
keywords equal to  '1000E' and '1000J', than it is to access the same
amount of data in a table with 1000 rows which has columns with the
TFORM keywords equal to '1E' and '1J'.  In the former case the 1000
floating point values in the first column are all written in a
contiguous block of the file which can be read or written quickly,
whereas in the second case each floating point value in the first
column is interleaved with the integer value in the second column of
the same row so FITSIO has to explicitly move to the position of each
element to be read or written.

9. Avoid the use of variable length vector columns in binary tables, since
any reading or writing of these data requires that FITSIO first
look up or compute the starting address of each row of data in the heap.

10. When copying data from one FITS table to another, it is faster to
transfer the raw bytes instead of reading then writing each column of
the table.  The FITSIO subroutines FTGTBS and FTPTBS (for ASCII
tables), and  FTGTBB and FTPTBB (for binary tables) will perform
low-level reads or writes of any contiguous range of bytes in a table
extension.  These routines can be used to read or write a whole row (or
multiple rows) of a table with a single subroutine call.   These
routines are fast because they bypass all the usual data scaling, error
checking and machine dependent data conversion that is normally done by
FITSIO, and they allow the program to write the data to the output file
in exactly the same byte order.  For these same reasons, use of these
routines can be somewhat risky because no validation or machine
dependent conversion is performed by these routines.  In general these
routines are only recommended for optimizing critical pieces of code
and should only be used by programmers who thoroughly understand the
internal byte structure of the FITS tables they are reading or
writing.

11.  Finally, external factors such as the type of magnetic disk
controller (SCSI or IDE), the size of the disk cache, the average seek
speed of the disk, the amount of disk fragmentation, and the amount of
RAM available on the system can all have a significant impact on
overall I/O efficiency.  For critical applications, a system
adminstrator should review the proposed system hardware to identify any
potential I/O bottlenecks.


\section{FITSIO Array Size Limitations}

In general, FITSIO places no limits on the sizes of the FITS files that
it reads or writes. In particular there is no internal limit on the size of the
dimensions of the primary array or IMAGE extension. Tables extensions may have
up to 999 columns (the maximum allowed by the FITS standard) and
may have an arbitrarily large number of rows. There are a few other limits,
however, which may affect some extreme cases:

1.  The maximum number of FITS files that may be simultaneously opened
by a single program is defined by the 'nb' parameter and is currently
set to 20.   To change this limit, one must globally edit the following
parameter statement:

\begin{verbatim}
        parameter (nb = 20)
\end{verbatim}
throughout the fitsio.f and the machine-specific source files.  The
number of physical buffers, as defined by the 'pb' parameter in the
machine specific source file, must be set greater than or equal to the
value of 'nb'.   Increasing the value of 'pb' will also require that
the size of the ftbuff common block be modified accordingly.

2.  The total number of FITS table columns that can be accessed by
FITSIO, when summed over the current HDU in all the open FITS files,
cannot exceed the value of the 'nf' parameter in the fitsio.f source
code.  This is currently set to 3000, which, for example, will allow
FITSIO to simultaneously read or write 3 FITS tables with 999 columns
each, or 20 tables with 150 columns each, or any other combination that
does not exceed 20 files and 3000 total columns.  (A FITS primary array
or image extension is equivalent to a 2 column table).  FITSIO
allocates 56 bytes of memory for each column to store various
descriptive information so substantially raising or lowering the value
of 'nf' can have a significant effect on the total amount of computer
memory required to run a program.

3.  The maximum number of extensions that can be read or written
in a single FITS file is current set to 512 as defined
by the 'ne' parameter statements throughout the fitsio.f and
machine specific source code files.  This value may be increased
if necessary, but the access times to the later extensions in such
files may become very long.

4.  FITSIO can handle FITS files up to about 2.1 GB in size which is
the maximum value of a signed long integer.  Some machines that use
8-byte words for a long integer may support larger files, but this has
not been tested.

\chapter{ Basic Interface Routines }

This section defines a basic set of subroutines that can be
used to perform the most common types of read and write operations
on FITS files.  New users should start with these subroutines and
then, as needed, explore the more advance routines described in
the following chapter to perform more complex or specialized operations.

A right arrow symbol ($>$) is used to separate the input parameters from
the output parameters in the  definition of each routine.  This symbol
is not actually part of the calling sequence.  Note that
the status parameter is both an input and an output parameter
and must be initialized = 0 prior to calling the FITSIO subroutines.

Refer to Chapter 9 for the definition of all the parameters
used by these interface routines.

\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[5 ] Create a primary array (if none already exists), or insert a
    new IMAGE extension immediately following the CHDU.
    Any following extensions will be shifted down to make room for
    the new extension.  If there are no other following extensions
    then the new image extension will simply be appended to the
   end of the file.  The new extension will become the CHDU.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTIIMG(unit,bitpix,naxis,naxes, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[6 ] Insert a new ASCII TABLE extension immediately following the CHDU.
    Any following extensions will be shifted down to make room for
    the new extension.  If there are no other following extensions
    then the new table extension will simply be appended to the
   end of the file.  The new extension will become the CHDU.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTITAB(unit,rowlen,nrows,tfields,ttype,tbcol,tform,tunit,extname, >
               status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[7 ] Insert a new binary table extension immediately following the CHDU.
    Any following extensions will be shifted down to make room for
    the new extension.  If there are no other following extensions
    then the new bintable extension will simply be appended to the
   end of the file.  The new extension will become the CHDU.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTIBIN(unit,nrows,tfields,ttype,tform,tunit,extname,varidat > status)
\end{verbatim}

\section{Keyword I/O Routines}


\begin{description}
\item[1 ]Put (append) an 80-character record into the CHU.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPREC(unit,card, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ] Put (append) a new keyword of the appropriate datatype into the CHU.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPKY[JLS](unit,keyword,keyval,comment, > status)
        FTPKY[EDFG](unit,keyword,keyval,decimals,comment, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ]Get the nth 80-character header record from the CHU.  The first keyword
   in the header is at key\_no = 1;  if key\_no = 0 then this subroutine
   simple moves the internal pointer to the beginning of the header
   so that subsequent keyword operations will start at the top of
  the header; it also returns a blank card value in this case.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGREC(unit,key_no, > card,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[4 ] Get a keyword value (with the appropriate datatype) and comment from
   the CHU
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGKY[EDJLS](unit,keyword, > keyval,comment,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[5 ] Delete an existing keyword record.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTDKEY(unit,keyword, > status)
\end{verbatim}


\section{Data I/O Routines}

The following routines read or write data values in the current HDU of
the FITS file.  Automatic datatype conversion
will be attempted for numerical datatypes if the specified datatype is
different from the actual datatype of the FITS array or table column.


\begin{description}
\item[1 ]Write elements into the primary data array or image extension.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPPR[BIJED](unit,group,fpixel,nelements,values, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ] Read elements from the primary data array or image extension.
    Undefined array elements will be
    returned with a value = nullval, unless nullval = 0 in which case no
    checks for undefined pixels will be performed. The anyf parameter is
    set to true (= 1) if any of the returned
   elements were undefined.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGPV[BIJED](unit,group,fpixel,nelements,nullval, > values,anyf,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ] Write elements into an ASCII or binary table column. The `felem'
    parameter applies only to vector columns in binary tables and is
   ignored when writing to ASCII tables.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPCL[SLBIJEDCM](unit,colnum,frow,felem,nelements,values, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[4 ] Read elements from an ASCII or binary table column.  Undefined
    array elements will be returned with a value = nullval, unless nullval = 0
    (or = ' ' for ftgcvs) in which case no checking for undefined values will
    be performed. The ANYF parameter is set to true if any of the returned
   elements are undefined.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGCV[SBIJEDCM](unit,colnum,frow,felem,nelements,nullval, >
                       values,anyf,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[5 ] Get the table column number and full name of the column whose name
    matches the input template string.  See the `Advanced Interface Routines'
   chapter for a full description of this routine.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGCNN(unit,casesen,coltemplate, > colname,colnum,status)
\end{verbatim}


\chapter{  Advanced Interface Subroutines }

This chapter defines all the available subroutines in the FITSIO user
interface. For completeness, the basic subroutines described in the
previous chapter are also repeated here. A right arrow symbol is used
here to separate the input parameters from the output parameters in the
definition of each subroutine. This symbol is not actually part of the
calling sequence. An alphabetical list and definition of all the
parameters is given at the end of this section. The SPP interface
subroutines have the same arguments but have names that begin with 'fs'
rather than 'ft'.


\section{FITS File Open and Close Subroutines: \label{FTOPEN}}


\begin{description}
\item[1 ]Open an existing FITS file with readonly or readwrite access
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTOPEN(unit,filename,rwmode, > blocksize,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ]Open and initialize a new empty FITS file
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTINIT(unit,filename,blocksize, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ]Flush internal buffers of data to the output FITS file
   previously opened with ftopen or ftinit.  The routine usually
   never needs to be called, but doing so will ensure that
   if the program subsequently aborts, then the FITS file will
  have at least been closed properly.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTFLUS(unit, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[4 ]Close a FITS file previously opened with ftopen or ftinit
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTCLOS(unit, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[5 ] Close and DELETE a FITS file previously opened with ftopen or ftinit.
    This routine may be  useful in cases where a FITS file is created, but
   an error occurs which prevents the complete file from being written.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTDELT(unit, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[6 ] Get the value of an unused I/O unit number which may then be used
    as input to FTOPEN or FTINIT.  This routine searches for the first
    unused unit number in the range from with 99 down to 50.   This
    routine just keeps an internal list of the allocated unit numbers
    and does not physically check that the Fortran unit is available (to be
    compatible with the SPP version of FITSIO).  Thus users must not
    independently allocate any unit numbers in the range 50 - 99
    if this routine is also to be used in the same program.  This
    routine is provided for convenience only, and it is not required
   that the unit numbers used by FITSIO be allocated by this routine.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGIOU( > iounit, status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[7 ] Free (deallocate) an I/O unit number which was previously allocated
    with FTGIOU.   All previously allocated unit numbers may be
   deallocated at once by calling FTFIOU with iounit = -1.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTFIOU(iounit, > status)
\end{verbatim}


\section{HDU-Level Operations \label{FTMAHD}}

When a FITS file is first opened or created, the internal buffers in
FITSIO automatically point to the first HDU in the file.  The following
routines may be used to move to another HDU in the file.  Note that
the HDU numbering convention used in FITSIO  denotes the primary array
as the first HDU, the first extension in a FITS file is the second HDU,
and so on.


\begin{description}
\item[1 ] Move to a specified (absolute) HDU in the FITS file (nhdu = 1 for the
   FITS primary array)
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTMAHD(unit,nhdu, > hdutype,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ]Move to a new (existing) HDU forward or backwards relative to the CHDU
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTMRHD(unit,nmove, > hdutype,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ]Get the number of the current HDU in the FITS file (primary array = 1)
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGHDN(unit, > nhdu)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[4 ]Create (append) a new empty HDU following the last extension that
    has been previously accessed by the program.   This will overwrite
    any extensions in an existing FITS file if the program has not already
    moved to that (or a later) extension using the FTMAHD or FTMRHD routines.
    For example, if an existing FITS file contains a primary array and 5
    extensions and a program (1) opens the FITS file, (2) moves to
    extension 4, (3) moves back to the primary array, and (4) then calls
    FTCRHD, then the new extension will be written following the 4th
   extension, overwriting the existing 5th extension.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTCRHD(unit, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[5 ] Insert a new IMAGE extension immediately following the CHDU.
    Any following extensions will be shifted down to make room for
    the new extension.  If there are no other following extensions
    then the new image extension will simply be appended to the
   end of the file.  The new extension will become the CHDU.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTIIMG(unit,bitpix,naxis,naxes, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[6 ] Insert a new ASCII TABLE extension immediately following the CHDU.
    Any following extensions will be shifted down to make room for
    the new extension.  If there are no other following extensions
    then the new table extension will simply be appended to the
   end of the file.  The new extension will become the CHDU.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTITAB(unit,rowlen,nrows,tfields,ttype,tbcol,tform,tunit,extname, >
               status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[7 ] Insert a new binary table extension immediately following the CHDU.
    Any following extensions will be shifted down to make room for
    the new extension.  If there are no other following extensions
    then the new bintable extension will simply be appended to the
   end of the file.  The new extension will become the CHDU.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTIBIN(unit,nrows,tfields,ttype,tform,tunit,extname,varidat > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[8 ] Resize an image by modifing the size, dimensions, and/or datatype of the
    current primary array or image extension. If the new image, as specified
    by the input arguments, is larger than the current existing image
    in the FITS file then zero fill data will be inserted at the end
    of the current image and any following extensions will be moved
    further back in the file.  Similarly, if the new image is
    smaller than the current image then any following extensions
    will be shifted up towards the beginning of the FITS file
    and the image data will be truncated to the new size.
    This routine rewrites the BITPIX, NAXIS, and NAXISn keywords
   with the appropriate values for new image.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTRSIM(unit,bitpix,naxis,naxes,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[9 ]Delete the CHDU in the FITS file.  Any following HDUs will be shifted
    forward in the file, to fill in the gap created by the deleted HDU.
    This routine will only delete extensions; the primary array (the
    first HDU in the file) cannot be deleted.  Note that Fortran
    (unfortunately) does not have the facility to decrease the size
    of an existing file, therefore the physical size of the FITS file
    will not change and the end of the file will be padded out with
    zeros to fill in the space left after the CHDU is deleted. If
    there are more extensions in the file following the one that is deleted,
    then the the CHDU will be defined to point to the following extension.
    If there are no following extensions then the CHDU will be redefined
    to point to the previous extension (or the primary array if there
    was only one extension in the file).  The output HDUTYPE parameter
    indicates the type of the new CHDU after the previous CHDU has been
   deleted.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTDHDU(unit, > hdutype,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[10] Copy the entire CHDU from the FITS file associated with IUNIT to the CHDU
    of the FITS file associated with OUNIT. The output HDU must be empty and
    not already contain any keywords.  Space will be reserved for MOREKEYS
    additional  keywords in the output header if there is not already enough
   space.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTCOPY(iunit,ounit,morekeys, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[11] Copy just the data from the CHDU associated with IUNIT
    to the CHDU associated with OUNIT. This will overwrite
    any data previously in the OUNIT CHDU.  This low level routine is used
    by FTCOPY, but it may also be useful in certain application programs
    which want to copy the data from one FITS file to another but also
    want to modify the header keywords in the process. all the required
    header keywords must be written to the OUNIT CHDU before calling
   this routine
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTCPDT(iunit,ounit, > status)
\end{verbatim}


\section{Define or Redefine the structure of the CHDU \label{FTRDEF}}

It should rarely be necessary to call the subroutines in this section.
FITSIO internally calls these routines whenever necessary, so any calls
to these routines by application programs will likely be redundant.


\begin{description}
\item[1 ] This routine forces FITSIO to scan the current header keywords that
    define the structure of the HDU (such as the NAXISn, PCOUNT and GCOUNT
    keywords) so that it can initialize the internal buffers that describe
    the HDU structure.  This routine may be used instead of the more
    complicated calls to ftpdef, ftadef or ftbdef.  This routine is
    also very useful for reinitializing the structure of an HDU,
    if the number of rows in a table, as specified by the NAXIS2 keyword,
   has been modified from its initial value.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTRDEF(unit, > status)   (DEPRECATED)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ]Define the structure of the primary array or IMAGE extension.  When
   writing GROUPed FITS files that by convention set the NAXIS1 keyword
   equal to 0, ftpdef must be called with naxes(1) = 1, NOT 0, otherwise
   FITSIO will report an error status=308 when trying to write data
   to a group. Note: it is usually simpler to call FTRDEF rather
  than this routine.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPDEF(unit,bitpix,naxis,naxes,pcount,gcount, > status)  (DEPRECATED)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ] Define the structure of an ASCII table (TABLE) extension. Note: it
   is usually simpler to call FTRDEF rather than this routine.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTADEF(unit,rowlen,tfields,tbcol,tform,nrows > status) (DEPRECATED)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[4 ] Define the structure of a binary table (BINTABLE) extension. Note: it
   is usually simpler to call FTRDEF rather than this routine.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTBDEF(unit,tfields,tform,varidat,nrows > status) (DEPRECATED)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[5 ] Define the size of the Current Data Unit, overriding the length
    of the data unit as previously defined by ftpdef, ftadef, or ftbdef.
    This is useful if one does not know the total size of the data unit until
    after the data have been written.  The size (in bytes) of an ASCII or
    Binary table is given by NAXIS1 * NAXIS2.  (Note that to determine the
    value of NAXIS1 it is often more convenient to read the value of the
    NAXIS1 keyword from the output file, rather than computing the row
    length directly from all the TFORM keyword values).  Note: it
   is usually simpler to call FTRDEF rather than this routine.

\begin{description}
\item[6 ] Define the zero indexed byte offset of the 'heap' measured from
    the start of the binary table data.  By default the heap is assumed
    to start immediately following the regular table data, i.e., at
    location NAXIS1 x NAXIS2.  This routine is only relevant for
    binary tables which contain variable length array columns (with
    TFORMn = 'Pt').  This subroutine also automatically writes
    the value of theap to a keyword in the extension header.  This
    subroutine must be called after the required keywords have been
    written (with ftphbn) and after the table structure has been defined
   (with ftbdef) but before any data is written to the table.

\section{FITS Header I/O Subroutines}


\subsection{Header Space and Position Routines \label{FTHDEF}}


\begin{description}
\item[1 ] Reserve space in the CHU for MOREKEYS more header keywords.
    This subroutine may be called to reserve space for keywords which are
    to be written at a later time, after the data unit or subsequent
    extensions have been written to the FITS file.  If this subroutine is
    not explicitly called, then the initial size of the FITS header will be
    limited to the space available at the time that  the first data is written
    to the associated data unit.   FITSIO has the ability to dynamically
    add more space to the header if needed, however it is more efficient
   to preallocate the required space if the size is known in advance.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTHDEF(unit,morekeys, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ] Return the number of existing keywords in the CHU (NOT including the
    END keyword which is not considered a real keyword) and the remaining
    space available to write additional keywords in the CHU.  (returns
    KEYSADD = -1 if the header has not yet been closed).
    Note that FITSIO will attempt to dynamically add space for more
   keywords if required when appending new keywords to a header.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGHSP(iunit, > keysexist,keysadd,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ] Return the number of keywords in the header and the current position
    in the header.  This returns the number of the keyword record that
    will be read next (or one greater than the position of the last keyword
    that was read or written). A value of 1 is returned if the pointer is
   positioned at the beginning of the header.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGHPS(iunit, > keysexist,key_no,status)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Read or Write Standard Header Routines \label{FTPHPR}}

These subroutines provide a simple method of reading or writing most of
the keyword values that are normally required in a FITS files.  These
subroutines are provided for convenience only and are not required to
be used.  If preferred, users may call the lower-level subroutines
described in the previous section to individually read or write the
required keywords.  Note that in most cases, the required keywords such
as NAXIS, TFIELD, TTYPEn, etc, which define the structure of the HDU
must be written to the header before any data can be written to the
image or table.


\begin{description}
\item[1 ] Put the primary header or IMAGE extension keywords into the CHU.
There are 2 available routines: The simpler FTPHPS routine is
equivalent to calling ftphpr with the default values of SIMPLE = true,
pcount = 0, gcount = 1, and EXTEND = true.  PCOUNT, GCOUNT and EXTEND
keywords are not required in the primary header and are only written if
pcount is not equal to zero, gcount is not equal to zero or one, and if
extend is TRUE, respectively.  When writing to an IMAGE extension, the
SIMPLE and EXTEND parameters are ignored.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPHPS(unit,bitpix,naxis,naxes, > status)

        FTPHPR(unit,simple,bitpix,naxis,naxes,pcount,gcount,extend, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ] Get primary header or IMAGE extension keywords from the CHU.  When
    reading from an IMAGE extension the SIMPLE and EXTEND parameters are
   ignored.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGHPR(unit,maxdim > simple,bitpix,naxis,naxes,pcount,gcount,extend,
               status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ] Put the ASCII table header keywords into the CHU The optional
TUNITn and EXTNAME keywords are written only if the input string
values are not blank.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPHTB(unit,rowlen,nrows,tfields,ttype,tbcol,tform,tunit,extname, >
               status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[4 ] Get the ASCII table header keywords from the CHU
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGHTB(unit,maxdim > rowlen,nrows,tfields,ttype,tbcol,tform,tunit,
               extname,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[5 ]Put the binary table header keywords into the CHU The optional
   TUNITn and EXTNAME keywords are written only if the input string
   values are not blank.  The pcount parameter, which specifies the
   size of the variable length array heap, should initially = 0;
   FITSIO will automatically update the PCOUNT keyword value if any
   variable length array data is written to the heap.  The TFORM keyword
   value for variable length vector columns should have the form 'Pt(len)'
   or '1Pt(len)' where `t' is the data type code letter (A,I,J,E,D, etc.)
   and  `len' is an integer specifying the maximum length of the vectors
   in that column (len must be greater than or equal to the longest
   vector in the column).  If `len' is not specified when the table is
   created (e.g., the input TFORMn value is just '1Pt') then FITSIO will
   scan the column when the table is first closed and will append the
   maximum length to the TFORM keyword value.  Note that if the table
   is subsequently modified to increase the maximum length of the vectors
   then the modifying program is responsible for also updating the TFORM
  keyword value.
\end{description}

        FTPHBN(unit,nrows,tfields,ttype,tform,tunit,extname,varidat > status)

\subsection{Write Keyword Subroutines \label{FTPREC}}


\begin{description}
\item[1 ]Put (append) an 80-character record into the CHU.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPREC(unit,card, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ] Put (append) a COMMENT keyword into the CHU.  Multiple COMMENT keywords
   will be written if the input comment string is longer than 70 characters.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPCOM(unit,comment, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ]Put (append) a HISTORY keyword into the CHU.  Multiple HISTORY keywords
   will be written if the input history string is longer than 70 characters.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPHIS(unit,history, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[4 ] Put (append) the DATE keyword into the CHU.  The keyword value will contain
    the current system date as a character string in 'dd/mm/yy' format. If
    a DATE keyword already exists in the header, then this subroutine will
   simply update the keyword value in-place with the current date.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPDAT(unit, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[5 ] Put (append) a new keyword of the appropriate datatype into the CHU.
    Note that FTPKYS will only write string values up to 68 characters in
    length; longer strings will be truncated.  The FTPKLS routine can be
   used to write longer strings, using a non-standard FITS convention.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPKY[JLS](unit,keyword,keyval,comment, > status)
        FTPKY[EDFG](unit,keyword,keyval,decimals,comment, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[6 ] Put (append) a string valued keyword into the CHU which may be longer
    than 68 characters in length.  This uses the Long String Keyword
    convention that is described in the "Usage Guidelines and Suggestions"
    section of this document.  Since this uses a non-standard FITS
    convention to encode the long keyword string, programs which use
    this routine should also call the FTPLSW routine to add some COMMENT
    keywords to warn users of the FITS file that this convention is
    being used.  FTPLSW also writes a keyword called LONGSTRN to record
    the version of the longstring convention that has been used, in case
    a new convention is adopted at some point in the future.   If the
    LONGSTRN keyword is already present in the header, then FTPLSW will
   simply return and will not write duplicate keywords.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPKLS(unit,keyword,keyval,comment, > status)
        FTPLSW(unit, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[7 ] Put (append) a new keyword with an undefined, or null, value into the CHU.
   The value string of the keyword is left blank in this case.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPKYU(unit,keyword,comment, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[8 ] Put (append) a numbered sequence of keywords into the CHU.   One may
    append the same comment to every keyword (and eliminate the need
    to have an array of identical comment strings, one for each keyword) by
    including the ampersand character as the last non-blank character in the
    (first) COMMENTS string parameter.  This same string
    will then be used for the comment field in all the keywords. (Note
    that the SPP version of these routines only supports a single comment
   string).
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPKN[JLS](unit,keyroot,startno,no_keys,keyvals,comments, > status)
        FTPKN[EDFG](unit,keyroot,startno,no_keys,keyvals,decimals,comments, >
                   status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[9 ] Put (append) a 'triple precision' keyword into the CHU in F28.16 format.
    The floating point keyword value is constructed by concatenating the
    input integer value with the input double precision fraction value
    (which must have a value between 0.0 and 1.0). The FTGKYT routine should
    be used to read this keyword value, because the other keyword reading
   subroutines will not preserve the full precision of the value.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPKYT(unit,keyword,intval,dblval,comment, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[10] Append the physical units string to an existing keyword.  This
    routine uses a local convention, shown in the following example,
    in which the keyword units are enclosed in square brackets in the
   beginning of the keyword comment field.
\end{description}


\begin{verbatim}
     VELOCITY=                 12.3 / [km/s] orbital speed

        FTPUNT(unit,keyword,units, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Insert Keyword Subroutines \label{FTIREC}}


\begin{description}
\item[1 ] Insert a new keyword record into the CHU at the specified position
    (i.e., immediately preceding the (keyno)th keyword in the header.)
    This 'insert record' subroutine is somewhat less efficient
    then the 'append record' subroutine (FTPREC) described above because
   the remaining keywords in the header have to be shifted down one slot.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTIREC(unit,key_no,card, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ] Insert a new keyword into the CHU.  The new keyword is inserted
    immediately following the last keyword that has been read from the header.
    These 'insert keyword' subroutines are somewhat less efficient then
    the 'append keyword' subroutines described above because the remaining
   keywords in the header have to be shifted down one slot.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTIKY[JLS](unit,keyword,keyval,comment, > status)
        FTIKY[EDFG](unit,keyword,keyval,decimals,comment, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ] Insert a new keyword with an undefined, or null, value into the CHU.
   The value string of the keyword is left blank in this case.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTIKYU(unit,keyword,comment, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Read Keyword Subroutines \label{FTGREC}}

These routines return the value of the specified keyword(s).  Wild card
characters (*, ?, or \#) may be used when specifying the name of the keyword
to be read: a '?' will match any single character at that position in the
keyword name and a '*' will match any length (including zero) string of
characters.  The '\#' character will match any consecutive string of
decimal digits (0 - 9). Note that when a wild card is used in the input
keyword name, the routine will only search for a match from the current
header position to the end of the header.  It will not resume the search
from the top of the header back to the original header position as is done
when no wildcards are included in the keyword name.  If the desired
keyword string is 8-characters long (the maximum length of a keyword
name) then a '*' may be appended as the ninth character of the input
name to force the keyword search to stop at the end of the header
(e.g., 'COMMENT *' will search for the next COMMENT keyword).  The
ffgrec routine may be used to set the starting position when doing
wild card searches.


\begin{description}
\item[1 ]Get the nth 80-character header record from the CHU.  The first keyword
   in the header is at key\_no = 1;  if key\_no = 0 then this subroutine
   simple moves the internal pointer to the beginning of the header
   so that subsequent keyword operations will start at the top of
  the header; it also returns a blank card value in this case.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGREC(unit,key_no, > card,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ] Get the name, value (as a string), and comment of the nth keyword in CHU.
    This routine also checks that the returned keyword name (KEYWORD) contains
    only legal ASCII characters.  Call FTGREC and FTPSVC to bypass this error
   check.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGKYN(unit,key_no, > keyword,value,comment,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ] Get the 80-character header record for the named keyword
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGCRD(unit,keyword, > card,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[4 ] Get the next keyword whose name matches one of the strings in
    'inclist' but does not match any of the strings in 'exclist'.
    The strings in inclist and exclist may contain wild card characters
    (*, ?, and \#) as described at the beginning of this section.
    This routine searches from the current header position to the
    end of the header, only, and does not continue the search from
    the top of the header back to the original position.  The current
    header position may be reset with the ftgrec routine.  Note
    that nexc may be set = 0 if there are no keywords to be excluded.
    This routine returns status = 202 if a matching
   keyword is not found.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGNXK(unit,inclist,ninc,exclist,nexc, > card,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[5 ]  Get the literal keyword value as a character string.  Regardless
     of the datatype of the keyword, this routine simply returns the
     string of characters in the value field of the keyword along with
    the comment field.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGKEY(unit,keyword, > value,comment,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[6 ] Get a keyword value (with the appropriate datatype) and comment from
   the CHU
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGKY[EDJLS](unit,keyword, > keyval,comment,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[7 ] Get a sequence of numbered keyword values
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGKN[EDJLS](unit,keyroot,startno,max_keys, > keyvals,nfound,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[8 ] Get the value of a floating point keyword, returning the integer and
    fractional parts of the value in separate subroutine arguments.
    This subroutine may be used to read any keyword but is especially
   useful for reading the 'triple precision' keywords written by FTPKYT.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGKYT(unit,keyword, > intval,dblval,comment,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[9 ] Get the physical units string in an existing keyword.  This
    routine uses a local convention, shown in the following example,
    in which the keyword units are
    enclosed in square brackets in the beginning of the keyword comment
    field.  A blank string is returned if no units are defined
    for the keyword.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
    VELOCITY=                 12.3 / [km/s] orbital speed

        FTGUNT(unit,keyword, > units,status)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Modify Keyword Subroutines \label{FTMREC}}

Wild card characters, as described in the Read Keyword section, above,
may be used when specifying the name of the keyword to be modified.


\begin{description}
\item[1 ] Modify (overwrite) the nth 80-character header record in the CHU
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTMREC(unit,key_no,card, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ] Modify (overwrite) the 80-character header record for the named keyword
    in the CHU.  This can be used to overwrite the name of the keyword as
   well as its value and comment fields.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTMCRD(unit,keyword,card, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ] Modify (overwrite) the name of an existing keyword in the CHU

\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTMCOM(unit,keyword,comment, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[5 ] Modify the value and comment fields of an existing keyword in the CHU.
    Optionally, one may modify only the value field and leave the comment
    field unchanged by setting the input COMMENT parameter equal to
   the ampersand character (\&).
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTMKY[JLS](unit,keyword,keyval,comment, > status)
        FTMKY[EDFG](unit,keyword,keyval,decimals,comment, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[6 ] Modify the value of an existing keyword to be undefined, or null.
    The value string of the keyword is set to blank.
    Optionally, one may leave the comment field unchanged by setting the
   input COMMENT parameter equal to the ampersand character (\&).
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTMKYU(unit,keyword,comment, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Update Keyword Subroutines \label{FTUCRD}}


\begin{description}
\item[1 ] Update an 80-character record in the CHU.  If the specified keyword
    already exists then that header record will be replaced with
    the input CARD string.  If it does not exist then the new record will
   be added to the header.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTUCRD(unit,keyword,card, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ] Update the value and comment fields of a keyword in the CHU.
    The specified keyword is modified if it already exists (by calling
   FTMKYx) otherwise a new keyword is created by calling FTPKYx.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTUKY[JLS](unit,keyword,keyval,comment, > status)
        FTUKY[EDFG](unit,keyword,keyval,decimals,comment, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ] Update the value of an existing keyword to be undefined, or null,
    or insert a new undefined-value keyword if it doesn't already exist.
   The value string of the keyword is left blank in this case.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTIKYU(unit,keyword,comment, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Delete Keyword Subroutines \label{FTDREC}}


\begin{description}
\item[1 ] Delete an existing keyword record.  The space previously occupied by
    the keyword is reclaimed by moving all the following header records up
    one row in the header.  The first routine deletes a keyword at a
    specified position in the header (the first keyword is at position 1),
    whereas the second routine deletes a specifically named keyword.
    Wild card characters, as described in the Read Keyword section, above,
    may be used when specifying the name of the keyword to be deleted
   (be careful!).

\section{Data Scaling and Undefined Pixel Parameters  \label{FTPSCL}}

These subroutines define or modify the internal parameters used by
FITSIO to either scale the data or to represent undefined pixels.
Generally FITSIO will scale the data according to the values of the BSCALE
and BZERO (or TSCALn and TZEROn) keywords, however these subroutines
may be used to override the keyword values.  This may be useful when
one wants to read or write the raw unscaled values in the FITS file.
Similarly, FITSIO generally uses the value of the BLANK or TNULLn
keyword to signify an undefined pixel, but these routines may be used
to override this value.  These subroutines do not create or modify the
corresponding header keyword values.


\begin{description}
\item[1 ] Reset the scaling factors in the primary array or image extension; does
    not change the BSCALE and BZERO keyword values and only affects the
    automatic scaling performed when the data elements are written/read
    to/from the FITS file.   When reading from a FITS file the returned
    data value = (the value given in the FITS array) * BSCALE + BZERO.
    The inverse formula is used when writing data values to the FITS
    file.  (NOTE: BSCALE and BZERO must be declared as Double Precision
   variables).
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPSCL(unit,bscale,bzero, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ] Reset the scaling parameters for a table column; does not change
    the TSCALn or TZEROn keyword values and only affects the automatic
    scaling performed when the data elements are written/read to/from
    the FITS file.  When reading from a FITS file the returned data
    value = (the value given in the FITS array) * TSCAL + TZERO.  The
    inverse formula is used when writing data values to the FITS file.
    (NOTE: TSCAL and TZERO  must be declared as Double Precision
   variables).
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTTSCL(unit,colnum,tscal,tzero, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ] Define the integer value to be used to signify undefined pixels in the
    primary array or image extension.  This is only used if BITPIX = 8, 16,
    or 32.  This does not create or change the value of the BLANK keyword in
   the header.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPNUL(unit,blank, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[4 ] Define the string to be used to signify undefined pixels in

   of the TNULLn keyword.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTSNUL(unit,colnum,snull > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[5 ] Define the value to be used to signify undefined pixels in
    an integer column in a binary table (where TFORMn = 'B', 'I', or 'J').
   This does not create or  change the value of the TNULLn keyword.

\section{FITS Primary Array or IMAGE Extension I/O Subroutines \label{FTPPR}}

    These subroutines put or get data values in the primary data array
(i.e., the first HDU in the FITS file) or an IMAGE extension.  The
data array is represented as a single one-dimensional array of
pixels regardless of the actual dimensionality of the array, and the
FPIXEL parameter gives the position within this 1-D array of the first
pixel to read  or write.  Automatic data type conversion is performed
for numeric data (except for complex data types) if the data type of
the primary array (defined by the BITPIX keyword) differs from the data
type of the array in the calling subroutine.  The data values are also
scaled by the BSCALE and BZERO header values as they are being written
or read from the FITS array.  The ftpscl subroutine MUST be
called to define the scaling parameters when writing data to the FITS
array or to override the default scaling value given in the header when
reading the FITS array.

    Two sets of subroutines are provided to read the data array which
differ in the way undefined pixels are handled.  The first set of
routines (FTGPVx) simply return an array of data elements in which
undefined pixels are set equal to a value specified by the user in the
'nullval' parameter.  An additional feature of these subroutines is
that if the user sets nullval = 0, then no checks for undefined pixels
will be performed, thus increasing the speed of the program.  The
second set of routines (FTGPFx) returns the data element array and, in
addition, a logical array which defines whether the corresponding data
pixel is undefined.  The latter set of subroutines may be more
convenient to use in some circumstances, however, it requires an
additional array of logical values which can be unwieldy when working
with large data arrays.  Also for programmer convenience, sets of
subroutines to directly read or write 2 and 3 dimensional arrays  have
been provided, as well as a set of subroutines to read or write any
contiguous rectangular subset of pixels within the n-dimensional array.

The following 4 subroutines transfer FITS images with 2 or 3 dimensions
to or from a data array which has been declared in the calling program.
The dimensionality of the FITS image is passed by the naxis1, naxis2,
and naxis3 parameters and the declared dimensions of the program array
are passed in the dim1 and dim2 parameters.  Note that the program array
does not have to have the same dimensions as the FITS array, but must
be at least as big.  For example if a FITS image with NAXIS1 = NAXIS2 = 400
is read into a program array which is dimensioned as 512 x 512 pixels,
then the image will just fill the lower left corner of the array
with pixels in the range 1 - 400 in the X an Y directions.  This has
the effect of taking a contiguous set of pixel value in the FITS array
and writing them to a non-contiguous array in program memory
(i.e., there are now some blank pixels around the edge of the image
in the program array).

The following subroutines transfer a rectangular subset of the pixels
in a FITS N-dimensional image to or from an array which has been
declared in the calling program.  The fpixels and lpixels parameters
are integer arrays which specify the starting and ending pixels in each
dimension of the FITS image that are to be read or written.  (Note that
these are the starting and ending pixels in the FITS image, not in the
declared array). The array parameter is treated simply as a large
one-dimensional array of the appropriate datatype containing the pixel
values; The pixel values in the FITS array are read/written  from/to
this program array in strict sequence without any gaps;  it is up to
the calling routine to correctly interpret the dimensionality of this
array.  The two families of FITS reading routines (FTGSVx and FTGSFx
subroutines) also have an 'incs' parameter which defines the
data sampling interval in each dimension of the FITS array.  For
example, if incs(1)=2 and incs(2)=3 when reading a 2-dimensional
FITS image, then only every other pixel in the first dimension
and every 3rd pixel in the second dimension will be returned in
the 'array' parameter. [Note: the FTGSSx family of routines which
were present in previous versions of FITSIO have been superseded
by the more general FTGSVx family of routines.]

\section{FITS ASCII and Binary Table Data I/O Subroutines}


\subsection{Column Information Subroutines \label{FTGCNO}}


\begin{description}
\item[1 ] Get the table column number (and name) of the column whose name
matches an input template name.  The table column names are defined by
the TTYPEn keywords in the FITS header.  If a column does not have a
TTYPEn keyword, then these routines assume that the name consists of
all blank characters.  These 2 subroutines perform the same function
except that FTGCNO only returns the number of the matching column whereas
FTGCNN also returns the name of the column.  If CASESEN = .true. then
the column name match will be case-sensitive.

The input column name template (COLTEMPLATE) is (1) either the exact
name of the column to be searched for, or (2) it may contain wild cards
characters (*, ?, or \#), or (3) it may contain the number of the desired
column (where the number is expressed as ASCII digits).  The first 2 wild
cards behave similarly to UNIX filename matching:  the '*' character matches
any sequence of characters (including zero characters) and the '?'
character matches any single character.  The \# wildcard will match
any consecutive string of decimal digits (0-9).  As an example, the template
strings 'AB?DE', 'AB*E', and 'AB*CDE' will all match the string
'ABCDE'.  If more than one column name in the table matches the
template string, then the first match is returned and the status value
will be set to 237 as a warning that a unique match was not found.  To
find the other cases that match the template, simply call the
subroutine again leaving the input status value equal to  237 and the
next matching name will then be returned.  Repeat this process until a
status = 219 (column name not found) is returned.  If these subroutines
fail to match the template to any of the columns in the table, they
lastly check if the template can be interpreted as a simple positive
integer (e.g., '7', or '512') and if so, they return that column
number.  If no matches are found then a status = 219 error is
returned.

Note that the FITS Standard recommends that only letters, digits, and
the underscore character be used in column names (with no embedded
spaces in the name).  Trailing blank characters are not significant.
It is recommended that the column names in a given table be unique
within the first 8 characters.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGCNO(unit,casesen,coltemplate, > colnum,status)
        FTGCNN(unit,casesen,coltemplate, > colname,colnum,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ] Get the datatype of a column in an ASCII or binary table.  This
    routine returns an integer code value corresponding to the datatype
    of the column. (See the FTBNFM and FTASFM subroutines in the Utilities
    section of this document for a list of the code values).  The vector
    repeat count (which is alway 1 for ASCII table columns) is also returned.
    If the specified column has an ASCII character datatype (code = 16) then
    the width of a unit string in the column is also returned.  Note that
    this routine supports the local convention for specifying arrays of
    strings within a binary table character column, using the syntax
    TFORM = 'rAw' where 'r' is the total number of characters (= the width
    of the column) and 'w' is the width of a unit string within the column.
    Thus if the column has TFORM = '60A12' then this routine will return
   datacode = 16, repeat = 60, and width = 12.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGTCL(unit,colnum, > datacode,repeat,width,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ] Get information about an existing ASCII table column.  (NOTE: TSCAL and
    TZERO must be declared as Double Precision variables).  All the
   returned parameters are scalar quantities.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGACL(unit,colnum, >
               ttype,tbcol,tunit,tform,tscal,tzero,snull,tdisp,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[4 ] Get information about an existing binary table column. (NOTE: TSCAL and
    TZERO must be declared as Double Precision variables). DATATYPE is a
    character string which returns the datatype of the column as defined
    by the TFORMn keyword (e.g., 'I', 'J','E', 'D', etc.).  In the case
    of an ASCII character column, DATATYPE will have a value of the
    form 'An' where 'n' is an integer expressing the width of the field
    in characters.  For example, if TFORM = '160A8' then FTGBCL will return
    DATATYPE='A8' and REPEAT=20.   All the returned parameters are scalar
   quantities.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGBCL(unit,colnum, >
               ttype,tunit,datatype,repeat,tscal,tzero,tnull,tdisp,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[ 5] Put (append) a TDIMn keyword whose value has the form '(l,m,n...)'
    where l, m, n... are the dimensions of a multidimension array
   column in a binary table.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPTDM(unit,colnum,naxis,naxes, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[ 6] Return the number of and size of the dimensions of a table column.
    Normally this information is given by the TDIMn keyword, but if
    this keyword is not present then this routine returns NAXIS = 1
   and NAXES(1) equal to the repeat count in the TFORM keyword.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGTDM(unit,colnum,maxdim, > naxis,naxes,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[ 7] Return the optimal number of rows to read or write at one time for
    maximum I/O efficiency.  Refer to the ``Optimizing Code'' section
   in Chapter 5 for more discussion on how to use this routine.
\end{description}

\subsection{Low-Level Table Access Subroutines \label{FTGTBS}}

The following subroutines provide low-level access to the data in ASCII
or binary tables and are mainly useful as an efficient way to copy all
or part of a table from one location to another.  These routines simply
read or write the specified number of consecutive bytes in an ASCII or
binary table, without regard for column boundaries or the row length in
the table.  The first two subroutines read or write consecutive bytes
in a table to or from a character string variable, while the last two
subroutines read or write consecutive bytes to or from a variable
declared as a numeric data type (e.g., INTEGER, INTEGER*2, REAL, DOUBLE
PRECISION).  These routines do not perform any machine dependent data
conversion or byte swapping, except that conversion to/from ASCII
format is performed by the FTGTBS and FTPTBS routines on machines which
do not use ASCII character codes in the internal data representations
(e.g., on IBM mainframe computers).


\begin{description}
\item[1 ] Read a consecutive string of characters from an ASCII table
    into a character variable (spanning columns and multiple rows if necessary)
    This routine should not be used with binary tables because of
   complications related to passing string variables between C and Fortran.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGTBS(unit,frow,startchar,nchars, > string,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ] Write a consecutive string of characters to an ASCII table
    from a character variable (spanning columns and multiple rows if necessary)
    This routine should not be used with binary tables because of
   complications related to passing string variables between C and Fortran.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPTBS(unit,frow,startchar,nchars,string, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ] Read a consecutive array of bytes from an ASCII or binary table
    into a numeric variable (spanning columns and multiple rows if necessary).
    The array parameter may be declared as any numerical datatype as long
    as the array is at least 'nchars' bytes long, e.g., if nchars = 17,
   then declare the array as INTEGER*4 ARRAY(5).
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGTBB(unit,frow,startchar,nchars, > array,status)

\begin{description}
\item[4 ] Write a consecutive array of bytes to an ASCII or binary table
    from a numeric variable (spanning columns and multiple rows if necessary)
    The array parameter may be declared as any numerical datatype as long
    as the array is at least 'nchars' bytes long, e.g., if nchars = 17,
   then declare the array as INTEGER*4 ARRAY(5).
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPTBB(unit,frow,startchar,nchars,array, > status)
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{High-Level Table Access Subroutines \label{FTIROW}}

These subroutines put or get data values in the current ASCII or Binary table
extension.  Automatic data type conversion is performed for numerical data
types (B,I,J,E,D) if the data type of the column (defined by the TFORM keyword)
differs from the data type of the calling subroutine.  The data values are also
scaled by the TSCALn and TZEROn header values as they are being written to
or read from the FITS array.  The fttscl subroutine MUST be used to define the
scaling parameters when writing data to the table or to override the default
scaling values given in the header
when reading from the table.

    In the case of binary tables with vector elements, the 'felem'
parameter defines the starting pixel within the element vector.  This
parameter is ignored with ASCII tables. Similarly, in the case of
binary tables the 'nelements' parameter specifies the total number of
vector values read or written (continuing on subsequent rows if
required) and not the number of table elements.  Two sets of
subroutines are provided to get the column data which differ in the way
undefined pixels are handled.  The first set of routines (FTGCV)
simply return an array of data elements in which undefined pixels are
set equal to a value specified by the user in the 'nullval' parameter.
An additional feature of these subroutines is that if the user sets
nullval = 0, then no checks for undefined pixels will be performed,
thus increasing the speed of the program.  The second set of routines
(FTGCF) returns the data element array and in addition a logical array
of flags which defines whether the corresponding data pixel is undefined.


\begin{description}
\item[1 ] Insert blank rows into an existing ASCII or binary table (in the CDU).
    All the rows FOLLOWING row FROW are shifted down by NROWS rows.  If
    FROW = 0 then the blank rows are inserted at the beginning of the
    table.  This routine modifies the NAXIS2 keyword to reflect the new
   number of rows in the table.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTIROW(unit,frow,nrows, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ] Delete rows from an existing ASCII or binary table (in the CDU).
    The NROWS number of rows are deleted, starting with row FROW, and
    any remaining rows in the table are shifted up to fill in the space.
    This routine modifies the NAXIS2 keyword to reflect the new number
    of rows in the table.  Note that the physical size of the FITS file will
    not be reduced by this operation, and the empty FITS blocks if any
   at the end of the file will be padded with zeros.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTDROW(unit,frow,nrows, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ] Insert a blank column (or columns) into an existing ASCII or binary
    table (in the CDU).  COLNUM specifies the column number that the (first)
    new column should occupy in the table.  NCOLS specifies how many
    columns are to be inserted. Any existing columns from this position and
    higher are moved over to allow room for the new column(s).
    The index number on all the following keywords will be incremented
    if necessary to reflect the new position of the column(s) in the table:
    TBCOLn, TFORMn, TTYPEn, TUNITn, TNULLn, TSCALn, TZEROn, TDISPn, TDIMn,
    TLMINn, TLMAXn, TDMINn, TDMAXn, TCTYPn, TCRPXn, TCRVLn, TCDLTn, TCROTn,

\begin{description}
\item[4 ] Delete a column from an existing ASCII or binary table (in the CDU).
    The index number of all the keywords listed above (for FTICOL) will be
    decremented if necessary to reflect the new position of the column(s) in
    the table.  Those index keywords that refer to the deleted column will
    also be deleted.  Note that the physical size of the FITS file will
    not be reduced by this operation, and the empty FITS blocks if any
   at the end of the file will be padded with zeros.

    substituting the appropriate FITS null value for any elements that
    are equal to NULLVAL.  This family of routines must NOT be used to
    write to  variable length array columns. For ASCII TABLE extensions, the
    null value defined by the previous call to FTSNUL will be substituted;
    For integer FITS columns, in a binary table  the null value
    defined by the previous call to FTTNUL will be substituted;
    For floating point FITS columns a special IEEE NaN (Not-a-Number)
   value will be substituted.

\item[7 ] Put bit values into a binary byte ('B') or bit ('X') table column (in the
    CDU).  LRAY is an array of logical values corresponding to the sequence of
    bits to be written.  If LRAY is true then the corresponding bit is
    set to 1, otherwise the bit is set to 0.  Note that in the case of
    'X' columns, FITSIO will write to all 8 bits of each byte whether
    they are formally valid or not.  Thus if the column is defined as
    '4X', and one calls FTPCLX with  fbit=1 and nbit=8, then all 8 bits
    will be written into the first byte (as opposed to writing the
    first 4 bits into the first row and then the next 4 bits into the
    next row), even though the last 4 bits of each byte are formally
   not defined.

    array elements will be returned with a value = nullval, unless nullval = 0
    (or = ' ' for ftgcvs) in which case no checking for undefined values will
    be performed. The ANYF parameter is set to true if any of the returned
    elements are undefined. (Note: the ftgcl routine simple gets an array
    of logical data values without any checks for undefined values;  use
    the ftgcfl routine to check for undefined logical elements).
    (The SPP FSGCVS routine has an additional integer argument after
    the VALUES character string which specifies the size of the 1st

    are specified by fpixels(naxis+1) and lpixels(naxis+1), and hence

    of each byte whether they are formally valid or not.  Thus if the
    column is defined as '4X', and one calls FTGCX with  fbit=1 and
    nbit=8, then all 8 bits will be read from the first byte (as
    opposed to reading the first 4 bits from the first row and then the
    first 4 bits from the next row), even though the last 4 bits of
   each byte are formally not defined.

\begin{description}
\item[14] Read any consecutive set of bits from an 'X' or 'B' column and
    interpret them as an unsigned n-bit integer. NBIT must be less than
    or equal to 16 when calling FTGCXI, and less than or equal to 32 when
    calling FTGCXJ; there is no limit on the value of NBIT for FTGCXD, but
    the returned double precision value only has 48 bits of precision on
    most 32-bit word machines.  The NBITS bits are interpreted as an
    unsigned integer unless NBITS = 16 (in FTGCXI) or 32 (in FTGCXJ) in which
    case the string of bits are interpreted as 16-bit or 32-bit 2's
    complement signed integers.  If NROWS is greater than 1 then the
    same set of bits will be read from sequential rows in the table
    starting with row FROW.  Note that the numbering convention
    used here for the FBIT parameter adopts 1 for the first element of the
   vector of bits;  this is the Most Significant Bit of the integer value.

\section{Celestial Coordinate System Subroutines \label{FTGICS}}

The following subroutines are provided to help calculate the
transformation between pixel location in an image and the corresponding
celestial coordinates on the sky.  These support the following standard
map projections:  -SIN, -TAN, -ARC, -NCP, -GLS, -MER, and -AIT (these
are the legal values for the coordtype parameter).  These routines are
based on similar functions in Classic AIPS.  All the angular quantities
are given in units of degrees. (Note: these subroutines are provisional
and may change slightly in a future release of FITSIO).


\begin{description}
\item[1 ] Get the values of all the standard FITS celestial coordinate system
    keywords from the header of a FITS image (i.e., the primary array or
    an image extension).  These values may then be passed to the subroutines
   that perform the coordinate transformations.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGICS(unit, > xrval,yrval,xrpix,yrpix,xinc,yinc,rot,coordtype,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ] Get the values of all the standard FITS celestial coordinate system
    keywords from the header of a FITS table where the X and Y (or RA and
    DEC coordinates are stored in 2 separate columns of the table.
    These values may then be passed to the subroutines that perform the
   coordinate transformations.

\section{File Checksum Subroutines \label{FTPCKS}}

The following routines either compute or validate the checksums for the
CHDU.  The DATASUM keyword is used to store the numerical value of the
32-bit, 1's complement checksum for the data unit alone.  If there is
no data unit then the value is set to zero. The numerical value is
stored as an ASCII string of digits, enclosed in quotes, because the
value may be too large to represent as a 32-bit signed integer.  The
CHECKSUM keyword is used to store the ASCII encoded COMPLEMENT of the
checksum for the entire HDU.  Storing the complement, rather than the
actual checksum, forces the checksum for the whole HDU to equal zero.
If the file has been modified since the checksums were computed, then
the HDU checksum will usually not equal zero.  These checksum keyword
conventions are based on a paper by Rob Seaman published in the
proceedings of the ADASS IV conference in Baltimore in November 1994
and a later revision in June 1995.


\begin{description}
\item[1 ] Compute and write the DATASUM and CHECKSUM keyword values for the CHDU
    into the current header.  The DATASUM value is the 32-bit checksum
    for the data unit, expressed as a decimal integer enclosed in single
    quotes. The CHECKSUM keyword value is a 16-character string which
    is the ASCII-encoded value for the complement of the checksum for
    the whole HDU.  If these keywords already exist, their values
    will be updated only if necessary (i.e., if the file has been modified
   since the original keyword values were computed).
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPCKS(unit, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ] Update the CHECKSUM keyword value in the CHDU, assuming that the
    DATASUM keyword exists and already has the correct value.  This routine
    calculates the new checksum for the current header unit, adds it to the
    data unit checksum, encodes the value into an ASCII string, and writes
   the string to the CHECKSUM keyword.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTUCKS(unit, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ] Verify the CHDU by computing the checksums and comparing
    them with the keywords.  The data unit is verified correctly
    if the computed checksum equals the value of the DATASUM
    keyword.  The checksum for the entire HDU (header plus data unit) is
    correct if it equals zero.  The output DATAOK and HDUOK parameters
    in this subroutine are integers which will have a value = 1
    if the data or HDU is verified correctly, a value = 0
    if the DATASUM or CHECKSUM keyword is not present, or value = -1
   if the computed checksum is not correct.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTVCKS(unit, > dataok,hduok,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[4 ] Compute and return the checksum values for the CHDU (as
    double precision variables) without creating or modifying the
    CHECKSUM and DATASUM keywords.  This routine is used internally by
   FTVCKS, but may be useful in other situations as well.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGCKS(unit, > datasum,hdusum,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[5 ] Encode a checksum value (stored in a double precision variable)
    into a 16-character string.  If COMPLEMENT = .true. then the 32-bit
   sum value will be complemented before encoding.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTESUM(sum,complement, > checksum)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[6 ] Decode a 16 character checksum string into a double precision value.
    If COMPLEMENT = .true. then the 32-bit sum value will be complemented
   after decoding.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTDSUM(checksum,complement, > sum)
\end{verbatim}


\section{General Utility Subroutines \label{FTVERS}}

The following utility subroutines may be useful for certain applications:


\begin{description}
\item[1 ] Return the revision number of the fitsio library.
    This subroutine returns the current revision number of the FITSIO
    software library.  The revision number will be incremented whenever any
    modifications or enhancements are made to the code.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTVERS( > version)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[2 ] Return a code value indicating the word architecture of the computer
    that the program is running on.  The routine compares
    the internal architecture used to store floating point and integer
   numbers and returns one of the following codes:
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTARCH( > compid)

           compid = 1  -  VAX or Alpha VMS system
                    2  -  Decstation or Alpha OSF/1, or IBM PC
                    3  -  SUN workstation
                    4  -  IBM mainframe
                    0  -  unknown type of machine
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[3 ] Get the current system date.  The day, month and year are returned
   as integers.  The year value ranges from 00 to 99.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGSDT(> day,month,year,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[4 ] Return the starting byte address of the CHDU and the next HDU.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGHAD(iunit, > curaddr,nextaddr)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[5 ] Return the descriptive text string corresponding to a FITSIO error
    status code.   The 30-character length string contains a brief
   description of the cause of the error.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGERR(status, > errtext)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[6 ] Return the top (oldest) 80-character error message from the
    internal FITSIO stack of error messages and shift any remaining
    messages on the stack up one level.  Any FITSIO error will
    generate one or more messages on the stack.  Call this routine
    repeatedly to get each message in sequence.  The error stack is empty
   when a blank string is returned.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGMSG( > errmsg)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[7 ] Write an 80-character message to the FITSIO error stack.  Application
    programs should not normally write to the stack, but there may be
   some situations where this is desirable.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPMSG(errmsg)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[8 ]  Clear the entire error message stack.  This routine is useful
     to clear any error message that may have been generated by
     a non-fatal FITSIO error (such as failing to find an optional
    header keyword).  This routine is called without any arguments.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTCMSG
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[9 ] Convert a character string to uppercase (operates in place).
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTUPCH(string)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[10]  Compare the input template string against the reference string
    to see if they match.  The template string may contain wildcard
    characters: '*' will match any sequence of characters (including
    zero characters) and '%' will match any single character in the
    reference string.  If CASESN = .true. then the match will be
    case sensitive.  The returned MATCH parameter will be .true. if
    the 2 strings match, and EXACT will be .true. if the match is
    exact (i.e., if no wildcard characters were used in the match).
   Both strings must be 68 characters or less in length.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTCMPS(str_template,string,casesen, > match,exact)
\end{verbatim}


\begin{description}
\item[11] Test that the keyword name contains only legal characters: A-Z,0-9,
   hyphen, and underscore.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTTKEY(keyword, > status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[12] Parse a header keyword record.
    This subroutine parses the input header record to return the value (as
    a character string) and comment strings.  If the keyword has no
    value (columns 9-10 not equal to '= '), then the value string is returned
    blank and the comment string is set equal to column 9 - 80 of the
   input string.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTPSVC(card, > value,comment,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[13] Construct a sequence keyword name (ROOT + nnn).
    This subroutine appends the sequence number to the root string to create
   a keyword name (e.g., 'NAXIS' + 2 = 'NAXIS2')
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTKEYN(keyroot,seq_no, > keyword,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[14] Construct a sequence keyword name (n + ROOT).
    This subroutine concatenates the sequence number to the front of the
   root string to create a keyword name (e.g., 1 + 'CTYP' = '1CTYP')
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTNKEY(seq_no,keyroot, > keyword,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[15] Determine the datatype of a keyword value string.
    This subroutine parses the keyword value string (usually columns 11-30
   of the header record) to determine its datatype.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTDTYP(value, > dtype,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[16] Parse the 'TFORM' binary table column format string.
    This subroutine parses the input TFORM character string and returns the
    integer datatype code, the repeat count of the field, and, in the case
    of character string fields, the length of the unit string.  The following
    datatype codes are returned (the negative of the value is returned
   if the column contains variable-length arrays):
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
                Datatype                DATACODE value
                bit, X                   1
                byte, B                 11
                logical, L              14
                ASCII character, A      16
                short integer, I        21
                integer, J              41
                real, E                 42
                double precision, D     82
                complex                 83
                double complex          163

        FTBNFM(tform, > datacode,repeat,width,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[17] Parse the 'TFORM' keyword value that defines the column format in
    an ASCII table.  This routine parses the input TFORM character
    string and returns the datatype code, the width of the column,
    and (if it is a floating point column) the number of decimal places
    to the right of the decimal point.  The returned datatype codes are
    the same as for the binary table, listed above, with the following
    additional rules:  integer columns that are between 1 and 4 characters
    wide are defined to be short integers (code = 21).  Wider integer
    columns are defined to be regular integers (code = 41).  Similarly,
    Fixed decimal point columns (with TFORM = 'Fw.d') are defined to
    be single precision reals (code = 42) if w is between 1 and 7 characters
    wide, inclusive.  Wider 'F' columns will return a double precision
    data code (= 82).  'Ew.d' format columns will have datacode = 42,
   and 'Dw.d' format columns will have datacode = 82.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTASFM(tform, > datacode,width,decimals,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[18] Calculate the starting column positions and total ASCII table width
    based on the input array of ASCII table TFORM values.  The SPACE input
    parameter defines how many blank spaces to leave between each column
    (it is recommended to have one space between columns for better human
   readability).
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGABC(tfields,tform,space, > rowlen,tbcol,status)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[19] Parse a template string and return a formatted 80-character string
    suitable for appending to (or deleting from) a FITS header file.
    This subroutine is useful for parsing lines from an ASCII template file
    and reformatting them into legal FITS header records.  The formatted
    string may then be passed to the FTPREC, FTMCRD, or FTDKEY subroutines
   to append or modify a FITS header record.
\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
        FTGTHD(template, > card,hdtype,status)
\end{verbatim}
    The input TEMPLATE character string generally should contain 3 tokens:
    (1) the KEYNAME, (2) the VALUE, and (3) the COMMENT string.  The
    TEMPLATE string must adhere to the following format:


\begin{description}
\item[- ]     The KEYNAME token must begin in columns 1-8 and be a maximum  of 8
        characters long.  If the first 8 characters of the template line are
        blank then the remainder of the line is considered to be a FITS comment
        (with a blank keyword name).  A legal FITS keyword name may only
        contain the characters A-Z, 0-9, and '-' (minus sign) and
        underscore.  This subroutine will automatically convert any lowercase
        characters to uppercase in the output string.  If KEYNAME = 'COMMENT'
        or 'HISTORY' then the remainder of the line is considered to be a FITS
       COMMENT or HISTORY record, respectively.
\end{description}


\begin{description}
\item[- ]     The VALUE token must be separated from the KEYNAME token by one or more
        spaces and/or an '=' character.  The datatype of the VALUE token
        (numeric, logical, or character string) is automatically determined
        and  the output CARD string is formatted accordingly.  The value
        token may be forced to be interpreted as a string (e.g. if it is a
       string of numeric digits) by enclosing it in single quotes.
\end{description}


\begin{description}
\item[- ]     The COMMENT token is optional, but if present must be separated from
        the VALUE token by at least one blank space.  A leading '/' character
        may be used to mark the beginning of the comment field, otherwise the
        comment field begins with the first non-blank character following the
       value token.
\end{description}


\begin{description}
\item[- ]     One exception to the above rules is that if the first non-blank
        character in the template string is a minus sign ('-') followed
        by a single token, or a single token followed by an equal sign,
        then it is interpreted as the name of a keyword which is to be
       deleted from the FITS header.
\end{description}


\begin{description}
\item[- ]     The second exception is that if the template string starts with
        a minus sign and is followed by 2 tokens then the second token
        is interpreted as the new name for the keyword specified by
        first token.  In this case the old keyword name (first token)
        is returned in characters 1-8 of the returned CARD string, and
        the new keyword name (the second token) is returned in characters
        41-48 of the returned CARD string.  These old and new names
        may then be passed to the FTMNAM subroutine which will change
       the keyword name.
\end{description}

    The HDTYPE output parameter indicates how the returned CARD string
    should be interpreted:

\begin{verbatim}
        hdtype                  interpretation
        ------           -------------------------------------------------
           -2            Modify the name of the keyword given in CARD(1:8)
                         to the new name given in CARD(41:48)

           -1            CARD(1:8) contains the name of a keyword to be deleted
                         from the FITS header.

            0            append the CARD string to the FITS header if the
                         keyword does not already exist, otherwise update
                         the value/comment if the keyword is already present
                         in the header.

            1            simply append this keyword to the FITS header (CARD
                         is either a HISTORY or COMMENT keyword).

            2            This is a FITS END record; it should not be written
                         to the FITS header because FITSIO automatically
                         appends the END record when the header is closed.
\end{verbatim}
     EXAMPLES:  The following lines illustrate valid input template strings:

\begin{verbatim}
      INTVAL 7 This is an integer keyword
      RVAL           34.6   /     This is a floating point keyword
      EVAL=-12.45E-03  This is a floating point keyword in exponential notation
      lval F This is a boolean keyword
                  This is a comment keyword with a blank keyword name
      SVAL1 = 'Hello world'   /  this is a string keyword
      SVAL2  '123.5'  this is also a string keyword
      sval3  123+  /  this is also a string keyword with the value '123+    '
      # the following template line deletes the DATE keyword
      - DATE
      # the following template line modifies the NAME keyword to OBJECT
      - NAME OBJECT
