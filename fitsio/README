Build Procedures
----------------
configure         Unix script to build and customize the Makefile
configure.in      Used to create configure (used by autoconf)
Makefile          Dummy Unix Makefile (run configure to create the real one)
Makefile.in       Use by configure to build the Makefile
Makef90           Makefile to buile Fortran-90 version of FITSIO (Beta version)
makevms.com       Command file to build the FITSIO on VAX or ALPHA VMS.
makevmsd.com      Command file to build the FITSIO on ALPHA VMS with dfloat
acMakefiles.sit.hqx  PowerMac make files (use unbinhex and unstuff to decode)
fsplit.c          Source code for the fsplit program (used in the Makefile)
split.f           Fortran program to split fitsio.f and fitsfort.f into files
