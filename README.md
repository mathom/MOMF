# MOMF

This is a patched version of MOMF that will build on modern gfortran.
See the [manual](http://users-phys.au.dk/srf/STACC/ManMOMF.pdf) for more details.

## Requirements

`sudo apt-get install gfortran gcc`

## Building

Simply run `make` and it should build.
If in doubt, run a `make clean` before!
